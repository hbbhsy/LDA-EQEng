Abstract: Steel beam-columns subjected to seismic loading often experience inelastic cyclic local buckling, which leads to strain amplification within the locally buckled region. These strains are ultimately responsible for Ultra Low Cycle Fatigue or fracture. An approach is presented to estimate the evolution of local buckling induced strain at critical locations in steel wide-flanged members subjected to cyclic loading. The main scientific basis for the approach is a series of 26 Continuum Finite Element (CFE) models that investigate a range of configurations (member cross section, axial load, loading history). Based on these simulations, a 3-dimensional post-buckling mechanism defined by yield lines, rigid facets, and yielding zones is proposed. This mechanism provides a bridging relationship between member plastic hinge rotations and local buckling induced strains at the continuum level. Guidelines for estimating various parameters that define this mechanism are presented. The approach is extended to predict strain evolution under cyclic loading; this extension accounts for history effects associated with buckling, straightening, and re-buckling of the cross-section. The method is validated by comparing the predicted strain evolution to its counterpart as determined from CFE simulations. The results indicate that the proposed method is highly effective in predicting the evolution of local buckling induced strain, and shows minimal bias with respect to configurational parameters and loading history. As such, the method is a computationally efficient alternative to CFE simulations, which are currently the only means for estimating cyclic local buckling induced strains. Applications of the method are outlined along with a discussion of its limitations.

Abstract: This paper presents an experimental study on the flexural fatigue behavior of the typical high-speed rail profile 60E2 (UIC60) for five million load cycles. A resonant machine was applied to achieve a test program of different load levels with high loading frequency. This investigation focuses on the rail fatigue resistance under multiple minimum stress levels and different corrosion conditions. In comparison with historic investigations of rails for two million load cycles, this new rail profile shows better fatigue behavior even for 2.5 times more load cycles. In the end, a new Smith–diagram for five million load cycles is proposed.

Abstract: The main plant of steel reinforced concrete (SRC) structure is proposed for CAP1400 nuclear power plant (NPP) in high seismic zone, which not only has better mechanical properties than reinforced concrete structure plant, but also has lower maintenance cost than steel structure plant. The irregular SRC joints are inevitably appeared in the main plant due to the limitations of power generation technology and equipment. In this paper, quasi-static cyclic tests were carried out on three 1:4 reduced scale irregular external SRC joints to discuss the seismic performance of the joints in the NPP, mainly including the damage pattern, hysteretic behavior, load carrying capacity, stiffness degradation and ductility. In addition, the detailed 3D finite element (FE) models were established, in which the bond-slip behavior between the shaped steel and concrete was considered by using the developed software to add a huge number of non-linear spring elements, and the FE models were verified by the test results. Then, the parametric study on seismic performance of irregular external SRC joint was carried out, and the influence of each parameter on the seismic performance of the irregular external SRC joint was analyzed. Finally, the effective and economical reinforcement measures were proposed, and verified by the FE method.

Abstract: In large reinforced concrete (RC) columns for mega columns in high-rise buildings and plants, constructability is deteriorated due to difficulties in assembling long reinforcing bars. In the present study, U-shaped tie bars were studied to improve the constructability of large RC columns by replacing the hoops and cross ties with U-shaped tie bars. The compression loading test and cyclic lateral loading test were performed on RC columns to verify the effect of U-tie bars. For the test parameters, the types of U-tie bars, neutral axis depth of cross-section, and loading types were considered. The test results showed that the strength and deformation capacities of the columns using U-tie bars were comparable to those of the columns using conventional transverse reinforcement. Closely-spaced U-tie bars satisfactorily restrained early local buckling of the longitudinal bars and provided adequate confinement effect to the core concrete, without early failure of the U-bars. Further, design recommendations were discussed to use U-tie bars for transverse reinforcement in large columns.

Abstract: In this paper, research on the flexural behavior of prestressed composite beams with sandwich floor panels, rather than concrete slabs, is presented. The sandwich plate system (SPS) consisting of top and bottom steel faceplates with a high-density polyurethane core between the faceplates was used for the floor panels in this study. Full-scale experiments were conducted to investigate the flexural performance of prestressed SPS composite beams (PSCBs). The test results demonstrate that the PSCB specimen exhibited excellent ductile behavior after yielding, with ductility ratio as high as 12.6. The failure mode at the ultimate limit state was fracture of the installed steel strands, and the ultimate load was increased by 14% due to the strengthening effect of the steel strands. Transfer of forces between an SPS floor panel and steel beam was accomplished through bolted connections, and the specimen behaved well as fully composite beams. A theoretical method for estimating the flexural strength and stiffness of PSCBs is established, and a finite element model capable of predicting the flexural behavior of PSCBs is also proposed.

Abstract: In this study, optimal design axial stiffness of piles of the piled-raft in a vertical extension remodelled building will be estimated through theoretical and numerical approach. The range of the axial stiffness of existing piles (Kve) were displayed and the upper limit of the deteriorated existing piles were proposed by using the formula by Randolph and Wroth (1978), along with 38 cases of field data. In addition, the required axial stiffness of reinforcing piles (Kvr) in vertical extended building will be estimated based on the proposed axial stiffness of existing piles, and through computer-based method, PLAXIS 3D and Yonsei Piled-Raft (YSPR). After the validation of both numerical models used in this study, the calculation was first carried out to estimate the reference axial stiffness by using PLAXIS 3D. After the evaluation of the reference value, the required axial stiffness of reinforcing pile to rehabilitate the structural stability will be estimated by substituting the existing piles with axial stiffness of deteriorated existing piles using YSPR. The required axial stiffness of reinforcing pile will be displayed by three different slenderness ratio (L/D) and two different end-bearing condition. As a result, it was found that the axial stiffness of end-bearing reinforcing pile requires significant degree of increase to compensate with the deterioration of existing piles of the vertical extension remodelling.

Abstract: Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites have become widely accepted in the strengthening or seismic retrofitting of reinforced concrete (RC) columns in practice. FRP-confined rectangular concrete columns under concentric axial compression have been extensively studied, leading to many stress-strain models (i.e., concentric-loading stress-strain models). Although RC columns in practical structures are commonly subjected to combined axial compression and bending (i.e., eccentric compression), existing research on eccentrically-loaded FRP-confined rectangular RC columns has been much more limited. More specifically, the limited research available has generally been concerned with small-scale RC columns, and the applicability of existing concentric-loading stress-strain models for FRP-confined concrete in the analysis of large-scale eccentrically-loaded rectangular RC columns has not been properly clarified. This paper presents the results of an experimental study including eight large-scale FRP-confined rectangular RC columns tested under eccentric compression. The following key test variables were carefully examined in the experimental program: the load eccentricity, the direction of bending, and the FRP jacket thickness. A theoretical column model is then presented for predicting the responses of the test columns. It is shown that the direct use of a concentric-loading stress-strain model for FRP-confined concrete in the column model leads to significant errors in predicting the ultimate deformation of the test columns.

Abstract: Concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) columns have been widely used in the construction industry because of their excellent compression capacity and torsion resistance. Regarding traditional CFST columns, the H-CFST column with an additional H-section steel member embedded in the core concrete provides improved fire and compression resistance. In this study, the seismic performance of nine H-CFST columns under cyclic torsional and compression–cyclic torsional loads was experimentally analysed. In the experiments, the failure mode, torque versus torsional angle hysteresis, torque versus torsional angle skeleton, torsional stiffness degradation, and energy dissipation capacity were determined. The hysteretic curves of the H-CFST columns under torsion were relatively plump in shape and exhibited no ‘pinching’ phenomenon, and the torsional stiffness of the H-CFST columns under unloading and reverse loading was approximately equal to the initial torsional stiffness. In addition, the applied compression had remarkable effects on the torsional capacity, torsional ductility, torsional stiffness, and hysteretic loop energy dissipation of the H-CFST columns. The shear capacities of the steel and concrete under normal stress or combined normal and shear stress were determined based on the latest theories and test results. Moreover, design method for the determination of the torsional capacity of H-CFST columns under compressive torsion is proposed based on the test results, and the theoretical contribution ratio of the H-section steel, steel tube, and concrete in the H-CFST columns to the torsional capacity was determined.

Abstract: Freeze-thaw cycle (FTC) is a severe durability issue that can seriously degrade the seismic behaviors of concrete structures, especially in cold regions. In this paper, a finite element (FE) model is proposed to evaluate the seismic behaviors of reinforced concrete (RC) columns under FTC. Based on the results of tests on eight column specimens under cyclic load and FTC, a series of calculation studies on the seismic behaviors of specimens under FTC are investigated. And calculation results show a good fit with the corresponding test results. Furthermore, according to the verified FE model, 36 numerical cases are simulated to investigate the effects of parameters (including axial compression ratio and shear span-to-depth ratio) on the seismic behaviors (including ultimate bearing capacity, yield load, and ultimate displacement) of specimens under FTC. Calculation results indicate that the axial compression ratio and shear span-to-depth ratio have a great impact on the seismic behaviors of columns under FTC. Finally, a theoretical model, considering the effects of axial compression ratio and shear span-to-depth ratio, is established to predict the ultimate bearing capacity, yield load, and ultimate displacement of specimens under FTC. The accuracy of the prediction results is verified by comparing with the corresponding test results.

Abstract: This study makes an attempt at analyzing numerically the bending and free vibration behavior of multilayered composite cylindrical and spherical panels reinforced with graphene platelets (GPLs). A numerical model for the static and dynamic analyses of the GPL reinforced composite curved panels based on isogeometric analysis (IGA) combined with higher-order shear deformation shell theory is developed for the first time. NURBS (non-uniform rational B-spline) based IGA considered in the present investigation is capable of constructing exactly the complex geometries of the shell-type structures. The cylindrical and spherical panels are fabricated by stacking several layers in which the GPL concentration alters in a layerwise manner to form functionally graded (FG) structure. Uniform, FG-O, FG-X and FG-A types of GPL dispersions are taken into account. The Halpin-Tsai model is adopted to determine the effective modulus of elasticity, whilst the modified rule of mixture is utilized to estimate Poisson’s ratio and the mass density of the nanocompoiste curved panels. The motion equations for the static and dynamic problems are derived from the higher-order shear deformation shell theory established based on the Reddy’s shell theory, and NURBS based isogeometric formulation is made to obtain the central deflections and natural frequencies of the multilayered FG GPL strengthened composite curved panels. The validity of the present IGA method is first evidenced, followed by the illustrative parametric studies to further scrutinize the static and dynamic responses of the nanocomposite cylindrical and spherical panels with the various reinforcement schemes.

Abstract: Aiming to expand the structural applications of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC), the innovative approach of using the hybrid form of RAC-filled glass-fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP)–steel composite tube columns (RACFCTs) is particularly striking because of their optimal combining of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP), RAC and steel. The existing research relevant to RACFCTs is limited and is mainly concerned with seismic performance. This paper presents the first-ever axial compression test on RACFCTs having three different slenderness ratios ranging from 20 to 40; the effect of the recycled coarse aggregate (RA) replacement ratio is also examined. The main performance aspects evaluated in this study were the failure mode, ultimate condition, axial load–lateral deflection curves, load–strain curves, and dilation behavior. The test results clearly show the benefit of the GFRP–steel composite tube on the compression behavior of the columns. The test results also demonstrate that the RACFCTs with a high RA replacement ratio and a high slenderness ratio had more ductile behavior. Finally, a design equation for predicting the maximum capacity of RACFCTs was derived, and its applicability was examined. The proposed formula produced a close estimate of the test results.

Abstract: The formulation of Topology Optimisation (TO) problems related to dynamics is particularly challenging, due to some intrinsic difficulties of mathematical and numerical nature. This paper deals with the integration of specific physical quantities, such as eigen-frequencies and dynamic compliance, in a special TO algorithm, which combines a classical pseudo-density field with Non-Uniform Rational Basis Spline (NURBS) entities. In this framework, wherein some of the NURBS continuous parameters (i.e. control points and weights) are the new design variables, important advantages can be exploited. In particular, beyond the reduction of the number of design variables and the definition of an implicit filter zones, the post-processing phase involving the CAD reconstruction of the optimised geometry is immediate for 2D problems and it needs few operations in 3D. Classical TO problems dealing with structural dynamics, as the maximisation of the first eigen-frequency and the minimisation of the dynamic compliance, are formulated in the NURBS framework. Accordingly, the analytical expressions of the gradients of the considered physical quantities are derived in closed form. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an exhaustive numerical campaign is proposed and the algorithm is applied to both 2D and 3D benchmarks. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis of the final optimised solutions to the NURBS discrete parameters is provided as well.

Abstract: The design of FRP profile-concrete composite sections, including beams and decks, is usually governed by the shear strength of the FRP profiles. However, analytical methods that can precisely predict the shear capacity of the composite sections have not been well developed, because there is lack of knowledge of the FRP-concrete composite action and distribution of shear stress along the FRP. This paper investigates the shear behaviors of FRP-concrete composite sections and develops formulae to predict the shear capacity of the composite sections. First, flexural tests of three FRP-concrete composite beams were conducted to investigate the shear failure mode and interface behaviors. All the beams failed in FRP shear fracture along horizontal direction. Then, push-out tests were used to determine the slip property for the FRP-concrete interface which reveals that FRP stay-in-place form and steel bolts can ensure full and partial composite action, respectively. Based on the experimental study, closed-form equations to compute the maximum shear stress are derived and validated against experimental data in this paper and literature. Finally, simple yet reliable equations of shear capacity are derived and recommended for engineers to design the FRP-concrete composite sections.

Abstract: Earthen architecture represents one of the most widespread built heritage and shows many advantages from both the environmental and economic points of view. Disadvantages connected to low mechanical properties of earthen structures are often overcome, in historical buildings, through the employment of timber elements, which can increase a box-type behaviour enabling both in-plane and out-of-plane mechanisms, facilitating spread damage and avoiding disastrous collapses. In this study, overturning mechanisms that can activate during earthquakes are investigated employing the tools of limit analysis. Through the kinematic approach of limit analysis, geometrical and mechanical parameters most influencing the response to horizontal actions are analysed assuming different material models for masonry, i.e. finite compressive or tensile strengths, and presence of frictional strength. Within this framework, the presence of timber reinforcing elements is modelled providing a reasonable analysis method and sound results. Aiming at validation, the church of San Judas Tadeo de Malloa (Chile), built with traditional, earth-based, timber-reinforced masonries, is analysed interpreting the damage pattern suffered after the 2010 Maule earthquake (Mw 8.8). The study adapts the robust procedures of limit analysis to the peculiarities of earth-based structures, highlights the crucial role of timber elements in the response to horizontal actions, especially in areas with high seismic hazard, and proves that the beneficial effect of timber reinforcing systems can be adequately interpreted through the proposed procedure.

Abstract: This paper investigates the behavior of circular concrete columns reinforced with glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars and spirals under axial load. Nine circular low strength concrete columns of 230 mm diameter and 1500 mm height were constructed and tested. The test parameters included reinforcement type (GFRP and steel), longitudinal reinforcement ratio, and spacing of spirals. Most tested columns showed two peak loads. Test results revealed that the GFRP-RC columns behaved similarly to the steel-RC counterparts. However, the GFRP-RC columns gave a slightly lower first peak load compared to their counterparts reinforced with steel. Increasing the GFRP reinforcement ratio slightly enhanced the capacity of the columns. Highly confined columns showed better ductile failure and significantly increased the second peak load of the columns. Design equations that predict the capacity of FRP-RC columns were evaluated using the experimental data of this study. The results showed that the Canadian Standard Association equation was conservative especially for columns with high reinforcement ratios. In addition, three different confinement models were used to predict the maximum confined concrete strength and they gave reasonable predictions compared to the experimental ones. Furthermore, an existing analytical model was used to predict the load-axial displacement of the tested columns and it showed reasonable correlation with the experimental ones up to the first peak loads. However, significant deviations were observed at the post-peak stages.

Abstract: Textile Reinforced Concrete (TRC) is emerging as a promising alternative to ordinary Reinforced Concrete for the construction of durable, lightweight and more sustainable structures, with a large potential particularly in shells and thin members. Research on the response of TRC in bending and shear as so far been performed on the basis of different approaches: plain section analysis with compatibility conditions for bending and mostly empirical strength formulas for shear. This paper explores a comprehensive approach for modelling the TRC response both for bending and shear on the basis of the Elastic-Cracked Stress Field (ECSF) method. The results of two full-scale flanged members in TRC tested in three-point-bending are presented. The tests are investigated by using Digital Image Correlation and the results are used to validate the assumptions of the ECSF. This approach allows accounting for the peculiarities of the material (notably for the linear-brittle response of the fabric) and leads to consistent results, accurately predicting the structural response in terms of strength and deformation capacity. The method is finally validated with other tests from the scientific literature, showing consistent agreement with a low coefficient of variation.

Abstract: This paper develops a practical seismic design approach for an emerging lateral force resisting system consisting of self-centering panels and steel strip braces. The system combines the favorable re-centering feature of conventional self-centering building frames and the energy absorption capacity and high initial stiffness of concentrically braced frames. The system also overcomes the detrimental frame expansion effect that occurs in conventional self-centering building frames. Following the proposed design approach, multiple designs to achieve different performance objectives were performed for a representative three-story building in which the considered lateral force resisting system is used to resist the seismic forces. Nonlinear response history analyses were performed for the designs to evaluate the applicability and adequacy of the proposed design approach. Based on the analyses conducted in this research, it was found that the considered system designed using the proposed approach can meet both transient and residual inter-story drift requirements specified for the selected performance objectives. While an initial design per the proposed design approach may be inadequate, the re-design strategy recommended can help transform the design to an acceptable one after only one round of modification. Moreover, the high-mode effect appears nonnegligible in the considered system and this effect should be considered in the proposed approach through the use of the lateral distribution factor of seismic forces specifically for self-centering systems.

Abstract: Structural topology optimization has been successfully investigated to improve the designs of a variety of civil, mechanical and aerospace applications. While topology optimization for static loading is fairly well developed, methods for dynamic seismic loading remain a challenge. In this paper, dynamic topology optimization methods are reviewed and contrasted, focusing on frequency domain techniques. Inspired by earthquake engineering analysis methods, a dynamic topology optimization formulation called the sum of modal compliances (SMC) is proposed. By considering multiple eigenmodes, the structural vibration is minimized for a seismic excitation, described by a response spectrum. The formulation handles design-dependent loading, due to inertial effects, by performing a series of design-independent topology optimization problems, between which, the seismic modal load vector is updated. Applications for the lateral bracing of high-rise buildings on 2D and 3D examples demonstrate the capabilities of the procedure and conceptual understanding of optimization for seismic loading. Results demonstrate that the optimized topology is influenced by the earthquake frequency content, which is dependent on the soil and seismological effects beneath the structure.

The main function of the mullion couple is to transfer the lateral wind load on the glass panes to the main structural frame. During negative wind action (or suction), the male and female mullions lean on each other, and may achieve a capacity higher than the sum of their individual moment capacities. Under positive wind action (or pressure), the glass panes are assumed to provide full lateral restraint to the compression flanges of mullions, which is questionable. In addition, clips are sometimes used to increase the capacities of mullion couples without any evidence. Therefore, currently used mullion design methods could result in either conservative or unsafe designs. This study investigates the structural behaviour and capacity of mullion couples through full-scale wind simulation tests of a real facade assembly made of two unitized facade panels with and without clips under both negative and positive wind actions. This paper presents the full-scale test results and compares them with the current design rule predictions. Based on the comparisons, suitable conclusions and recommendations are given for the structural design of mullion couples under wind actions. Overall, this study has significantly advanced the current knowledge and understanding of the structural behaviour and capacity of unitized façade mullion couples subject to wind actions.

Abstract: The Concrete-infilled Double Steel Corrugated-plate Wall (CDSCW) consists of a corrugated part and two vertical boundary elements. The corrugated part is composed of two steel corrugated plates (SCPs) and infilled concrete, where high-strength bolts connect the two SCPs. The two vertical boundary elements are concrete filled steel tubulars. Obviously, owing to the corrugation configuration of SCPs as well as the positive interactive effect among SCPs, infilled concrete and vertical boundary elements, a CDSCW can attain high axial load-bearing efficiency and good seismic performance. This paper presents the experimental seismic performance of CDSCWs by exerting horizontal cyclic loads under constant axial compressions. Eight specimens were tested, with axial compression ratio, shear span to depth ratio and eccentricity of in-plane compressive load as the main research variables. The experimental results indicated all the specimens subjected to compression-bending failure with failure modes closely related to their axial compression ratios. There was a significant negative correlation between the axial compression ratio and the ductility of CDSCW specimens. In addition, the shear to span depth ratio had an important influence on the ductility of CDSCW specimens. Moreover, the experiment showed that the sectional axial strain distribution of CDSCW specimens conformed to the plane section assumption before reaching their peak load-bearing capacities, and most of the steel fibers except the ones near the neutral axis could be considered as plastic when the CDSCW specimens subjected to in-plane combined compression-bending-shear loads. Based on this, the formulae for estimating the load-bearing capacity of the CDSCW specimens under the combination of constant axial compressions and horizontal cyclic loads are established. The comparison between the formula values and the experimental results proves that the formulae are accurate and conservative. The conclusions of the experimental investigation provide fundamentals for the establishment of CDSCW seismic design method.

Abstract: In this work, the estimation of the fundamental period of vibration of masonry infilled RC frame structures is achieved using both Machine Learning techniques and concise nonlinear formulas. The data used are extracted from a recently published extensive database that associates the period with relevant information, such as the height of the structure, the span length between columns, the wall opening ratio, and the masonry wall stiffness. It is shown that, as compared to the utilized data, the proposed methods produce excellent results at the cost of various levels of complexity.

Abstract: In this paper, a modified finite elements method is presented to study vibrations of a suspended bridge under moving vehicles. In this study, coupled lateral and torsional vibrations of the deck and lateral vibrations of the main cables are considered. The deck is considered as an Euler-Bernoulli beam. The suspended cable theory with the sag ratio less than 10% is used to study the vibrations of the main cables. In the finite elements method used in this study, the vibrational equations of the curved elements of the main cables are calculated in the Cartesian coordinates and change of tension is considered in the equations. Finally, the Newmark method is used to solve the vibrational equations in the time domain. To verify the finite elements method, it is compared with an analytical solution which is applied to a numerical example of the problem.

Abstract: Safety evaluation of a bridge crossing a river under vessel impact is commonly conducted based on the original model of the bridge. However, the bridge may be subjected to local scour within its service time. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the safety of the bridge under multiple hazards: local scour and vessel impact. In this effort, the nonlinear dynamic performance of a double-pylon cable-stayed bridge is investigated by a high-resolution finite-element (FE) method. First, to validate the accuracy of the FE model, a drop-hammer test conducted by previous researchers is simulated, and the numerical results show that the impact force, displacement, and failure modes match with those in the test for each case. Based on the validation, an FE model that constructs a complex colliding system for a double-pylon cable-stayed bridge and a ship is created to conduct nonlinear dynamic analysis. The impact forces, deformation of the pylon and pile foundation, and crush depths of the ship are calculated. The findings indicate that (1) local scour has a small effect on the rising step of ship impact force but affects its descending step; (2) the displacement at the impact point significantly increases with scour depth; (3) scour reduces the crush depth of the ship bow when the ship collides at lower collision velocities; (4) the ship impacts activate the vibration of the high-rise pylon, and the resulting damage severity in the pylon increases with scour depth under the same collision condition. The findings in this study can be used to guide the analysis and design of large-span bridges to resist local scour and ship impact.

Abstract: Steel–concrete composite bridges with multi-box girders have been widely used in bridge structures owing to their advantages in terms of construction and mechanical behavior. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) provides a formula for calculating the load distribution factor (LDF), which is a key parameter in determining the internal force distribution in multi-girder bridges under live loads. To evaluate the performance of the AASHTO LRFD formula, the rigid-jointed girder (RJG) method is employed to obtain the transverse distribution influence line of each girder by considering the influence of the transverse connection beams, which is validated by field tests and finite element analysis. Based on the traversal algorithm composed of rough and refined calculations, LDF for moment can be obtained using the transverse distribution influence lines. In addition, information on 120 bridges, including 99 bridges in the literature and 21 actually built bridges designed or recommended by our research group, is collected for parametric analysis. On the basis of the parametric analysis, the relationship between LDF and the key parameters is determined, which helps derive an improved formula to calculate the LDF. Moreover, approximately 58% bridges’ errors exceed 10% based on the AASHTO formula, some of which even reach 30%. Compared with the AASHTO formula, only 5% bridges remain whose error exceeds 10% based on the improved formula for exterior girders. The improved formula for interior girders is the same as the former which is safe and precise because more than 80% bridge bridges’ errors are less than 10%. To sum up, the improved formula is found to be superior with higher accuracy and solid physical foundation.

Abstract: Cyclic loading tests with different protocols were conducted for a high strength low alloy steel. Based on the test results, the low cycle fatigue and extremely low cycle fatigue performance of the high strength steel was discussed and an appropriate constitutive model was established. The experimental results implied that the low and extremely cycle fatigue failure showed different fracture features. For low cycle fatigue, there was a strong negative linear correlation between the fatigue life and the strain amplitude in the log–log scale. However, they did not conform the linear relation when transiting to the low cycle fatigue. The steel represented obvious cyclic softening and good energy dissipation capacity. With the increase of strain amplitude, the softening degree decreased and equivalent damping ratio increased. The cyclic stress–strain curve could be descried by the Ramberg-Osgood model, and the strength coefficient and strain hardening exponent of this steel were larger than those of steel with lower strength. A combined hardening model was calibrated to describe the cyclic plasticity of the steel, and it was verified by the simulation results.

Abstract: Current seismic evaluation standards empirically developed the plastic deformation parameters for the nonlinear analysis of RC beams based on existing test results, without a firm theoretical background. It is well recognized that the modeling parameters might overestimate or underestimate the deformation capacity of concrete beams. This is partly because the nominal shear strength equation used to determine the modeling parameters showed significant deviation, compared to existing test results. The present study developed a theoretical plastic deformation model for the nonlinear analysis of RC beams under cyclic loading. The nonlinear parameters were determined based on the fundamental failure mechanism of concrete beams after flexural yielding. The proposed model was verified by comparing its predictions with existing experimental results and the predictions by the current seismic evaluation standard ASCE 41–17. Based on the proposed model, the effects of various design parameters on the nonlinear parameters were also analyzed and investigated in detail. In addition, analysis examples using the proposed parameters were presented.

Abstract: Concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) columns have been widely used in super tall buildings. Since these columns are subjected to very high axial loads, the use of high-strength concrete (HSC) is preferred in order to reduce their cross-sectional size. For applications in seismic regions, additional confinement to the HSC may be needed to ensure ductility. Among various approaches, spiral confinement is an effective and practical way for square CFST columns. Six spiral-confined concrete-filled steel tube (SCCFST) columns and three CFST columns with the concrete compressive strength of 111 MPa were tested under eccentric axial loading. The behavior of the columns under different levels of eccentricity ratio was investigated, and the use of high-strength spirals to further enhance confinement was also examined. Concrete crushing was found to be the main cause for the loss of the load-carrying capacity. Spiral reinforcement is not effective in increasing the load-carrying capacity; however, it can considerably improve ductility, which is improved with an increase of the yield strength of spiral reinforcement. Based on the test results, an equivalent uniaxial stress–strain model was developed for the HSC in CFST and SCCFST columns. A fiber beam-column element using the proposed stress–strain models was found to provide good predictions of the measured load–displacement responses. Such fiber element can be used for modeling of SCCCFST columns with HSC in nonlinear structural analysis of tall buildings.

Abstract: Timber connections may collapse in a brittle or in a ductile mode. The calculation models of timber joints are mainly focused on ductile failure mode, since it has been traditionally assumed that brittle failure was avoided by respecting a minimum spacing between fasteners. However, this assumption alone does not guarantee a ductile failure. This paper proposes a new design model dealing with brittle failure modes of timber connections with large diameter fasteners (those protruding the whole thickness of the timber member such as dowels or bolts). A comparison between the proposal and the existing models, using an extensive database of tests, is used to demonstrate the improved accuracy of the proposed design method.

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that the seismic incidence angle imposes a non-negligible impact on the seismic performance of curved bridges. The computational efficiency of some current methods for determining the critical angle needs to be improved and their applicability in practical engineering projects remains to be examined. For this reason, a resultant response-based (RRB) method is developed herein for assessing the critical excitation direction of curved bridges. To validate the feasibility of this method in an actual seismic design context, a 1/62.5-scale model of a three-span curved bridge is designed and a multi-angle shaking table test is implemented. Meanwhile, the finite-element model of the test specimen is set up, and the RRB method as well as the linear response-history analysis (LRHA) are comparatively assessed. The results indicate that the RRB method can capture the critical excitation direction of curved bridges with sufficient precision (error does not exceed 10% compared to LRHA). The associated computational effort is also substantially reduced given that RRB requires analysis solely along two orthogonal directions as the incidence angles, compared to standard response history analyses where ground motion excitation is applied at multiple ground motion orientations. The above observation is further verified by a well-designed experimental campaign, which demonstrates the accuracy and practicability of the RRB method for the case of realistic bridge configurations.

Abstract: For several decades, innovative studies on the external restraining system of the buckling-restrained brace (BRB) have focused on the design and application of BRBs. This paper presents a Spatial Triple-Truss-Confined BRB (STC-BRB) with a longitudinal shuttle-shape and investigates its buckling behaviour, static strength and seismic design. The STC-BRB could significantly improves the material utilization and particularly enhance the architectural aesthetics when it is used as an exposed design externally. The overall elastic buckling performance, load resistance and hysteretic responses of the STC-BRB are investigated numerically by adopting a finite element model (FEM) validated by previously conducted test results of a truss-confined BRB (TC-BRB). A design method regarding the lower limit of the restraining ratios of the STC-BRBs is recommended. First the overall elastic buckling performance of the STC-BRB is comprehensively investigated by using a beam element FEM, leading to an explicit expression for the overall elastic buckling load of the STC-BRB, which is further adopted to define a restraining ratio of the STC-BRB design. Consequently the load resistance of STC-BRBs under monotonic axial compression is numerically analyzed. Accordingly a lower limit of the restraining ratio of the STC-BRBs is recommended for monotonic axial load resistance design, such that the core reaches the fully sectional yield, along with a plasticity strain amplitude of 2% without a global instability of the STC-BRBs. Finally, the hysteretic responses of STC-BRBs subjected to axially compressive-tensile cyclic loads are studied numerically, and the corresponding lower limit of the restraining ratio of STC-BRBs is proposed in the design as an energy-dissipating device. The two lower limits of the restraining ratios of the STC-BRBs obtained in this study form fundamentals for the preliminary static and seismic design of STC-BRBs.

Abstract: The available literature on the shear strength of corrugated web steel beams (CWSBs) includes a wealth of methods that specify the nominal buckling capacity, but with no consideration of reliability-based design. In the framework of Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) codes, the design of steel members requires load factors to amplify the load effect and a resistance factor to scale-down the resistance based on a target reliability index. Therefore, for full integration of the shear design of CWSBs into the current design codes, resistance factors must be developed and calibrated for use within the LRFD context. This is crucial since the use of existing resistance factors that were specifically developed for welded plate girders for the design of CWSBs may lead to a level of safety that is not consistent with the philosophy of the code. Using a curated database of test results, the present paper attempts to address the lack of a reliability-based design method specific to CWSBs. Two North American design standards were selected in this study, namely, AISC 360 and CSA-S16. A series of reliability analyses are performed first to verify the consistency of reliability indices for welded plate girders designed following the two standards. Then, a probabilistic-based approach is used to calibrate the resistance factors for the shear limit state of CWSBs in accordance with the AISC 360 and CSA-S16 considering dead, live, wind, and snow loads. Finally, an iterative step-by-step procedure is then developed within the LRFD framework to aid in the design of corrugated webs to resist shear loads at ultimate. Findings of the study showed that the current AISC 360 resistance factor for welded plate girders when used for the shear design for CWSB, does not yield a safety level that is consistent with the target reliability; thus, a new factor equal to 0.85 is proposed. For CSA-S16, the current resistance factor of 0.90 for welded plate girders is found to be appropriate for corrugated web steel beams.

Abstract: This paper presents a numerical study of the influence of various parameters on the seismic response of the CAREM-25 nuclear power plant (NPP) located in Argentina. The influence of soil stiffness, structure-soil-structure interaction (3SI), and infill soil stiffness are studied. Considering the available analysis capabilities, a full 3D methodology was adopted (direct method). Two soil profiles were used in order to quantify the influence of the soil on the structural response. An engineered rockfill was also used in order to study the influence of infill soil stiffness. Three artificial records with three components each were used as free field input. These records were obtained from the site design spectra. The turbo-group building was approximately modelled in order to consider 3SI. Finally, all live loads as well as the water in pools were included in the model. Design guides for this type of problem are given for all the elements of the model. When comparing flexible soil with stiff soil, important reductions of the maximum absolute acceleration value are obtained by flexible soil. Moreover, the horizontal maximum accelerations are remarkably amplified in height in the case of stiff soil. The influence of the proximity of the turbo-group building (3SI) on the dynamic response of the reactor building is negligible. Finally, the influence of infill soil stiffness is also negligible.

Abstract: The building sector is responsible for a large portion of the global CO2e emissions. With structural materials accounting for a large part of it, the reduction of material used in buildings offers an important mitigation option to climate change. Standardized structural elements (eg. columns, beams, floors) have very low material efficiencies, as their shape does not consider the final use and load cases. New digital manufacturing technologies emerging in the field of construction and architecture, open new opportunities for the design of mass-customized structural elements, with the potential for more efficient use of materials in ubiquitous constructions. This paper offers a shaping methodology for the optimization of structural elements based on computational geometry and analytical mechanics. The paper implements the methodology for the shape optimization of mass timber beams. The methodology reveals that a large amount of structural material could be saved on standard structural timber elements. The accuracy of the solutions is benchmarked against analytical solutions and Finite Element Analysis (FEM). In order to implement the methodology for the optimization of timber beams, the analytical mechanics of shaped solid wooden beams are expanded from the existing literature and are presented in this paper. With the potential of being applied to a wider range of material systems, the methodology can significantly decrease the material consumption in a wide range of structural elements. Finally, the resulting optimized geometries demonstrate new objectives for the development of digital manufacturing techniques of mass-customized structures for the implementation in standard buildings.

Abstract: Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) based upon Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) constitutes an increasingly mature and widespread technology in the conservation of historic structures. Such techniques, while proved effective for assessing the global integrity of structures, may fail at detecting local damage with little influence on the modal features of the system. In this context, the analysis of propagating waves throughout the structure features a synergistic approach to OMA with superior capabilities for data-driven damage identification. Although some promising results have been reported in the literature on the application of Seismic Interferometry to reinforced-concrete structures, works concerning the continuous monitoring of ambient vibrations in historic structures are virtually non-existent. In this light, this paper proposes the coupled application of automated OMA and Ambient Noise Deconvolution Interferometry for the full structural system identification of historic structures, and evaluates the advantages of this technology through a validation case study of the Sciri Tower in Perugia, Italy. A continuous vibration-based monitoring system deployed in the tower during three weeks allows us to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The reported results demonstrate the robustness of the monitoring system for identifying environmental effects on the spatial distribution of wave velocities, and shed light into the dispersion relation of the tower.

Abstract: The simplified one-story asymmetric models cannot simulate the inelastic performance of controlled irregular multi-story frame type buildings subjected to extreme dynamic loadings, especially when the effect of higher modes on distribution of engineering demand parameters (EDPs) over the height of the structures is an important design factor. In the present study, controlled nonlinear seismic response of coupled translational–torsional irregular multi-story smart buildings is investigated. In order to control such nonlinear systems, a new robust adaptive model-based controller is introduced. This new adaptive model-based strategy, due to using adjustable parameters such as instant stiffness, could well consider the nonlinear behavior of the structure and act more precisely in controlling the torsional behavior of Magneto- Rheological (MR) dampers-equipped multi-story torsional buildings. The proposed controller uses the advantages of nonlinear static analysis in order to introduce the instant nonlinear stiffness of the structure into model-based control strategies such as LQR (Linear–Quadratic–Regulator) or LQG (Linear–Quadratic–Gaussian) and also Clipped Optimal algorithms. The proposed controller is applied to a set of low and mid-rise multi-story buildings equipped with MR dampers considering three different torsional behavior. The Fiber elements are employed to simulate the non-linear behavior of structural members. The findings of this study revealed the robustness of the proposed strategy to control the seismic inelastic torsional responses of multi-story buildings subjected to ordinary and pulse-like ground motions.

Abstract: Masonry buttressed arches have been designed in the past for vertical actions deriving from gravity loads and horizontal actions determined by the thrust of the arch. Horizontal actions consequent to earthquake motions were not usually taken into account in the design of these structures. This, despite of the high vulnerability of such typology, frequently characterizing monumental buildings. This paper addresses the problem of the capacity of buttressed masonry arches with a circular shape and different angles of embrace, under horizontal actions induced by seismic motions. To this aim, in the framework of Limit Analysis for masonry structures, the seismic analysis of a large sample of buttressed arches is provided and discussed. The outcomes of numerical analysis have shown that the activated failure mechanisms change in presence of horizontal actions. The results of the analysed large sample are very consistent in terms of lateral capacity since the horizontal load multiplier increases with the thickness of the buttresses and decreases with the buttress slenderness. The paper provides an unexpected result for thin arches since in this case semi-circular arches become more vulnerable than segmental.

Abstract: In this paper, a series of single-shear tests were carried out to investigate the bond behavior between carbon FRP (CFRP) and concrete under quasi-static and dynamic loadings. The local bond stress-slip relationship and the ultimate bond strength between CFRP and concrete with different compressive strengths under different slip rates between 1.2 × 10−5 m/s and 9 m/s were derived and compared. Test results showed that the ultimate bond strength, maximum bond stress and slip at maximum bond stress increase with the increase of slip rate, while the effective bond length is not sensitive to the slip rate. Based on the testing data, several empirical formulas were proposed to predict the ultimate bond strength, maximum bond stress and slip at maximum bond stress under different slip rates. A local bond stress-slip model, which incorporates the effect of the slip rate, was also established.

Abstract: Steel tube confined concrete (STCC) is widely used in the vertical members of high-rise buildings such as columns. The axial load is not directly resisted by the steel tube in STCC, but is resisted via the interfacial frictional stress between steel tube and concrete core, which is different with that of concrete filled steel tube (CFT) members and would effectively suppress the outward local buckling of steel tube at early stage. Recently, fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) confined STCC presents a potential to enhance the ductility and durability of such vertical elements. This paper presents an experimental study on monotonic axial compressive behaviour of carbon FRP (CFRP) confined STCC (CFRP-STCC) stub column and an analytical study on the confinement mechanism of and the ultimate axial bearing capacity of the elements. A three-stage confinement mechanism involving the different contributions of the steel tube and the CFRP wrap in CFRP-STCC elements was proposed based on the test results. A prediction model of the ultimate axial bearing capacity of CFRP-STCC stub columns was developed subsequently. Results show that the presence of CFRP wrap enhances effectively the load-bearing capacity and the ductility of steel tube confined plain concrete and reinforced concrete elements, and significantly prevents the local buckling of the steel tubes in the elements. The proposed prediction model of ultimate axial bearing capacity assesses test results with a great agreement.

Abstract: Prestressed concrete cylinder pipes (PCCPs) are widely used in large-scale water conveyance projects. It is important to study the mechanical properties and loading response of PCCPs to ensure trouble-free operation. There were insufficient test data pertaining to the deformation of the concrete cores (including the inner and the outer concrete core), the prestressing wire, the mortar coating, especially the steel cylinder. In this paper, a full-scale test was performed on a PCCP under internal water pressure through fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensing technology. The test results showed that the state of PCCPs would reach three limit-states successively. Firstly, the strains of the concrete cores, the prestressing wire, the steel cylinder and the mortar coating increased linearly with the growth of the internal water pressure. The cracks in the concrete cores indicated the beginning of the serviceability limit-state. The corresponding pressure is 1.8 MPa. The growth of the internal water pressure primarily affected the steel cylinder and the prestressing wire during the continuous period. When the steel cylinder yielded at the pressure of 2.25 MPa, the pipe reached its elastic limit-state. At last, the strength of the pipe decreased obviously as the cracks propagated throughout the concrete cores. The pipe would come to the strength limit-state until the prestressing wire yielded. The test results found that the internal water pressure relieved final prestress of the inner concrete core was different from that of the outer concrete core in the embedded-cylinder pipe (ECP). It was also proved that FBG sensing technology could be the continuous monitoring system for the condition assessment of PCCPs. In particular, the test results demonstrated that the appropriate quality of materials and proper operation guaranteed trouble-free operation of PCCPs. The objective of this research is to provide experimental references for the application of PCCPs and push back safety assessment of this type of large-diameter pipes.

Abstract: On the basis of the amazing theoretical finding that there is equivalence between the static transmissibility subjected to moving loads and the ratio of two influence lines in the frequency domain, a new approach is proposed to extract the influence lines for a beam-like structure under moving loads. To accommodate the uncertainties involved in the measurements as well as modelling error, the relationship between response measurements and the Fourier transform of influence lines is embedded in the framework of Bayesian inference with the aid of complex-valued probabilistic model of prediction error. The formulas are presented for closed-form transformation between the solutions of FFT coefficients and those of inverse FFT coefficients. Analytical solutions of the Most Probable Values (MPVs) as well as posterior uncertainties of the influence lines in both frequency domain and spatial domain are derived. Two applications are conducted to verify the efficiency and accuracy of the fast Bayesian scheme. It is shown that the new approach can be realized by avoiding the ill-poseness nature of inverse problem. Due to the introduction of the concept of static transmissibility, given that the reference influence line is known in advance, this method possesses an obvious advantage in avoiding using the knowledge of the moving loads. As a frequency-domain approach, it can reduce the computational complexity of influence line extraction by avoiding complicated matrix manipulation.

Abstract: Although plain bars are no longer used as reinforcing bars in new buildings, old-type concrete structures reinforced with plain bars are still in service, and the assessment and rehabilitation of these structures become increasingly important. In view of the column tension caused by vertical seismic actions, concrete within beam-column joints is likely under biaxial transverse tensions, which is extremely detrimental to the bond between concrete and reinforcements. In this paper, a comprehensive experimental study considering various concrete strengths and bar diameters is conducted to evaluate the rate-dependent bond characteristics of plain bars embedded in concrete subjected to biaxial transverse tensions. The main bond parameters are assessed quantitatively by numerical regression. The results show that the ultimate bond strength and the ratio of residual to ultimate bond strength are independent of the loading rate, whereas the slip at the ultimate bond stress decreases with increasing the loading rate. In addition, the modified BPE model is adopted to describe the local bond behavior of plain bars, and the model parameters involved are calibrated by experimental results. It is shown that the model can reasonably predict the bond performance of plain bars under different loading rates when the surrounding concrete is subjected to various biaxial transverse tensions.

Abstract: 3D-printing is an efficient method of designing customised structures and producing synthetic bone grafts appropriate for bone implants. This research aimed to manufacture a new multi-functionalised 3D-printed poly(lactic acid)/carbonated hydroxyapatite (PLA/cHA) scaffolds with mass proportions of 100/0, 95/5 and 90/10 in a bid to verify their potential application in tissue regeneration. The filaments of these hybrid materials were obtained by extrusion technique and subsequently used to manufacture the 3D-printed scaffolds, using a fused deposition modelling (FDM) technique. The scaffolds were characterised based on their thermal properties, microstructure and geometry by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), respectively, in addition to determination of their apparent porosities. The degradation of the scaffolds and the liberation of degradation products were evaluated in in vitro for different days under simulated physiological conditions. New microanalyses of mechanical behaviour of the materials: tensile and compression stresses, density, frequency analysis and optimisation with DSC were performed. While, evaluation of the surface luminance structure and the profile structure of the nanostructured PLA composite materials was done by SEM, in 3D printed form. The filter profile of cross-sectional view of the specimen was extracted and evaluated with Firestone curve of the Gaussian filter; checking the roughness and waviness profile of the structure. It was observed that the thermal properties of the composites were not affected by the manufacturing process. The microstructural analysis showed the effective incorporation of the ceramic filler in the polymer matrix as well as an acceptable PLA/cHA interaction. The degradation tests showed the presence of calcium and phosphorus in the studied medium, confirming their liberation from the composites during the incubation periods.

Abstract: The use of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars as internal reinforcement for concrete structures in aggressive environments has emerged as an innovative solution to eliminate corrosion problems. Glass FRP (GFRP) reinforcing bars have recently gained wide acceptance as a viable construction material for sustainable new constructions due to their costing less than other FRP types. This paper reports the test results for full-sized edge–column slab connections (ECS –connections) reinforced with sand coated GFRP bars. These connections were cast using normal-strength concrete (NSC) and high strength concrete (HSC). The effect of concrete strength (NSC and HSC) and moment-to-shear force ratio (M/V) (300 mm, 600 mm) on the performance of the tested connections were examined. In addition, a new mechanical model, called Modified Strip Model, is presented for punching-shear strength predictions of FRP reinforced concrete (RC) ECS –connections. The test results reveal that the use of HSC directly augmented the punching-shear strength and improved the load–deflection response of the tested connections, However, Increasing the M/V ratio produced significant shear stresses, thus decreasing the punching-shear strength for the NSC and HSC connections, respectively. The mechanical model presented herein takes into account all possible mechanisms of loads transfer in FRP-RC ECS-connections. Hence, a complete shear–moment (V-M) interaction diagram can be plotted to predict the punching strength of such connections. Moreover, the model revealed higher accuracy and narrower scatter for punching-shear strength predictions compared to other available equations in FRP design codes and guides. The EN 1992–1-1–05 punching-shear equation was also examined for FRP-RC ECS–connections and adapted to consider the tensile properties of the FRP bars instead of steel.

Abstract: With the recent development of timber as a viable structural material for high-rise structures, glulam braced frames have been recently introduced in lateral load-resisting systems of timber buildings. Based on a simple shape optimization problem of a braced frame, this paper explores one of the specificities of timber structures: the influence of semi-rigid connections on their overall structural behavior and design. Dowel-type connections are first studied to obtain a simplified relation between joint stiffness and axial load-carrying capacity. Then, the established local behavior law is introduced in the shape optimization process and design of a discrete braced frame subject to lateral drift constraint under wind load. The problem is solved by a COBYLA optimization method, combined with Optimality Criteria (OC) member sizing techniques. Solutions are then evaluated and compared with classical steel/concrete design. The semi-rigid behavior of connections finally leads to a significant increase in the volume of timber but also affects the optimal shape and topology of the X-braced frame compared with classical results.

Abstract: This paper experimentally investigated the seismic behavior of 9 full-scale reinforced concrete (RC) joints—8 precast RC joints and 1 cast-in-place RC joint—under cyclic loading. The precast concrete (PC) joints were divided into 3 types: cast-in-place, precast beam cast-in-place column, and fully precast with assembly. With the presence additional reinforcement at the joint core and debonding of reinforcement in some joints, the PC joints differed with other types of joints. The experimental results, such as hysteretic behavior, energy dissipation capacity and stiffness degradation, were analyzed, which showed that the PC joints with steel strands anchored into the joint core zone could meet the seismic code requirements. Additionally, a finite elementanalysis of the new type of PC joint was performed numerically, and the predicted seismic performance was in very good agreement with the experimental results. Finally, a skeleton model of the PC joint was established through parameter analysis.

Abstract: The present study investigates the effect of soil-structure interaction (SSI) on foundation motion recorded at accelerometric stations at the lowest storey of buildings. Towards this, four sites of instrumented buildings, having foundation and free-field ground motion recordings available, are studied in the frequency domain. The significance of such instrumentation is highlighted, especially in terms of assessing the way foundation tends to filter high frequency components of free-field motions. The well-known kinematic and inertial interaction decoupling is implemented for the sites studied and is assessed on the basis of its capability to reproduce the empirical findings and measurements. Parametric analyses are performed for each site in order to develop analytical expressions relating intensity and frequency content measures between the two motions. The expressions derived are verified through comparison with recorded data. The analysis procedure is then extrapolated to sites with various soil conditions as defined by a generic ground classification as per Eurocode 8. The produced analytical expressions can be utilized, under the conditions studied herein, for correcting motions recorded at the basement level of buildings, in order to estimate the “original” free-field ground motions. The latter being “building-free”, are most appropriate for the development of new generation GMPEs that are not biased by the influence of foundation presence and structural oscillation during ground motion recordings.

Abstract: External prestressing is an efficient technology to strengthen existing structures, and using fiber-reinforced polymers instead of steel in external tendons is advantageous to avoid corrosion-related problems, though anchoring external fiber-reinforced polymer tendons is still a major issue. An innovative anchoring technology is proposed in this paper for the external fiber-reinforced polymer tendons aimed to strengthen one-way reinforced concrete slabs. Six slab specimens were designed and manufactured to check the feasibility and reliability of the proposed technology. In one slab no external prestressing was applied (reference slab), while the remaining five slabs were strengthened by means of external post-tensioned glass fiber-reinforced polymer tendons, using the proposed anchoring system. The strengthened slabs differ for the prestressing level and external-tendon ratio. All slabs were tested up to failure and their flexural behaviors and failure modes were thoroughly investigated. The tests show that the proposed anchoring technology is reliable and efficient. A method for the calculation of the stress in the tendons at ultimate is also proposed. Finally, the numerical results are shown to agree fairly well with the test results.

Abstract: Traditional buildings, even with normal self-centering energy dissipation (SCED) braces, might suffer from large deformations and high mode effects under an extremely strong earthquake, leading to a concentration of inter-story drift in upper floors. To satisfy the requirements of resilience, larger post-yield stiffness and higher energy dissipation, a novel brace with pretensioned basalt fiber-reinforced polymer (BFRP) tendons and variable friction dampers (VFDs) was developed, and this brace was termed the self-centering variable friction damper (SC-VFD) brace. The variable stiffness and sliding force of the VFD system were theoretically analyzed. This was followed by quasi-static experiments on two VFD and two SC-VFD braces with different parameters. The theoretical analysis and experimental results revealed the same tendencies, demonstrating the reliability and feasibility of SC-VFD braces. The hysteretic curve of the SC-VFD braces exhibited stable and normal flag-shape behavior before the second activation, while the hysteresis curve indicated a variable flag-shape behavior with second activation, variable friction force, and larger post-yield stiffness when the brace slid at slope section. Compared with the VFD brace, the SC-VFD brace had the same energy dissipation ability but less residual displacement and lower equivalent viscous damping ratio. More combinations of disc springs in series resulted in smaller axial forces and lowers post-yielding stiffness, thereby decreasing the energy dissipation capability.

Abstract: In this study, shaking table tests were performed to investigate the dynamic interaction of a silty-clay soil with an irregular-section subway station. During the tests, a shape acceleration array (SAA) was used to measure the lateral deformation of the model soil, and a non-contact dynamic displacement testing method was applied to visualize and digitalize the seismic damage process of the station structure. Typical test results, including the dynamic earth pressure, seismic settlement, deformation, and acceleration of different levels of the structure, were interpreted. The results indicated that the movement of the subway station was more controlled by the surrounding silty-clay soil in terms of phase and amplitude. SAA can effectively measure the soil deformation, and the relationship between the relative lateral displacement and soil depth can be well fitted in a cosine function, especially when subjected to strong earthquakes. Seismic settlement is significantly linked to Arias intensity, and the subway station experienced significant uneven settlement, resulting in soil-structure separation in the vertical direction. The multi-story irregular-section subway station deforms in a shear mode. The maximum inter-story drift ratio was approximately 1/171. The components in the lower layers of the shallow-buried subway station structure, particularly in the central columns, underwent cumulative damage. Hence, more robust forms of structural members and the ductility of central columns should be carefully considered in the seismic design of subway station structures.

Abstract: Failure of residential buildings during floods is an important cause of damage and loss of life. In the case of the Netherlands, the collapse of buildings is implicitly included in current damage and mortality curves since these are generated from historical data. However, the Netherlands has not experienced destructive flooding since 1953, so damage functions for modern buildings do not exist. Therefore, this paper assesses the effect of floods on modern Dutch residences with laboratory tests and structural models in order to formulate physically-based fragility curves. The results gathered are also applicable to similarly-built masonry and cavity-wall rowhouses elsewhere. Almost half of the Dutch population live in terraced houses (also known as townhouses or rowhouses), of which the critical failure mechanism during a flood is out-of-plane bending of the load-bearing walls. Failure of these structural elements should be analysed with the pressure coefficient, Cp, instead of the currently used drag coefficient, CD, because wall collapse is more likely than displacement of the entire structure. This paper describes the quantification of both coefficients by conducting flume experiments on rectangular boxes with different geometries and orientations. Higher drag coefficients are derived from the experiments than provided by FEMA, resulting in higher hydrodynamic loads on the residences. The physical approach to evaluate the collapse of residences is exemplified with a case study of the three most common type of residences in the Netherlands. Structural analyses of their load-bearing walls subjected to a hydrostatic and hydrodynamic load perpendicular to the wall show failure due to milder flood conditions than the current damage curves do for all case study residences. A sensitivity analysis shows an important influence of wall thickness, initial axial loading of the wall, and the flood water level inside the residence.

Abstract: The structural performance of aluminium alloy unequal angle columns was investigated in this study. Fourteen columns made of two extruded aluminium alloy unequal angle cross-sections were tested. Complementary material property tests and geometric imperfection measurements were also carried out. The test setup, procedure and results were fully reported. After the tests, numerical models were developed to replicate the tested pin-ended extruded aluminium alloy unequal angle column behaviour. The validated finite element models were then adopted to analyse the effect of the configuration of initial geometric imperfections, which proved to be pivotal in mode interaction of the column buckling performance. Parametric studies were carried out with specific initial imperfection configuration to generate further numerical data. The ultimate resistances derived from the experiments and finite element analyses were employed to evaluate the applicability of the current codified standards. The result comparison shows that current design provisions yield unsafe predictions for pin-ended unequal angle columns since the buckling mode interaction is not considered. The development of applicable design proposals and further investigation into buckling modal participation for pin-ended extruded aluminium alloy unequal angle columns are required.

Abstract: Durability problems significantly affect the structural performance of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings: when exposed to aggressive environmental conditions, both steel reinforcing bars and concrete undergo relevant alterations of their mechanical performance (strength and deformation) leading to a general decrease of the bearing capacity of structural elements and, more in general, of the whole construction. Material deterioration can be responsible for the shift of the collapse mode from ductile/flexural mechanisms to brittle/shear ones in relation to the entity of corrosion attack, the materials used (both concrete strength class and reinforcement grade) and the structural details assumed according to the design. As well known, the Italian building stock is made up of structures realized, for the majority, without following specific seismic design features and to resist – mainly – gravitational vertical load combinations, until the introduction of the actual code after the dramatic earthquake event of L’Aquila 2008. For this reason, the deep knowledge of the structural performance of RC buildings realized neglecting (or simplifying) seismic action in presence of corrosion attack becomes a topic of relevant importance to determine possible solutions and improvement at section, element and whole building level. In the present paper, the effects of corrosion on two case study buildings designed following actual and past Italian codes for constructions (i.e. with and without respecting the capacity design approach) are then presented. The structural assessment in aggressive environmental conditions is performed adopting different entity and distribution scenarios of corrosion, taking into consideration the decrease of strength and deformation capacity of constitutive materials and the resulting loss of confinement affecting RC sections, allowing to determine the attainment of the ductile and brittle mechanisms and the modification of the structural performance.

Abstract: Grade S960 ultra-high strength steel is receiving increasing attention owing to its excellent strength-to-weight ratio. However, its application in construction engineering is rather limited due to the lack of adequate design rules, as the current established codes in Europe, North America and Australia/New Zealand only cover the design of steel components with material grades up to S700 (or S690). This prompts investigations into different types of S960 UHSS structural components and development of accurate and efficient design rules for them. The present paper focuses on press-braked S960 UHSS channel section columns prone to flexural buckling about the minor principal axes, with their behaviour and resistances thoroughly examined through experiments and numerical modelling. An experimental programme was firstly performed on two non-slender press-braked channel sections, with five column specimens of varying member lengths employed for each cross-section, and included initial global and local geometric imperfection measurements and pin-ended column tests about the minor principal axes. This was followed by a parallel numerical modelling programme, where finite element (FE) models were developed to simulate the experimental results and afterwards adopted to perform a parametric study to generate additional numerical data over a broader spectrum of cross-section dimensions and member lengths. It is worth noting that there were two orientations associated with minor-axis flexural buckling of press-braked S960 UHSS channel section columns, namely ‘C’ orientation (indicating that columns buckled towards the webs) and ‘reverse C’ orientation (indicating that columns buckled towards the flange tips), and both of the two types of failure modes were carefully examined in the present study. It was found that channel section columns failing by flexural buckling in the ‘reverse C’ orientation generally exhibited superior resistances relative to their counterparts with failure in the ‘C’ orientation. The experimental and numerical data were also used to assess the applicability of the codified provisions for press-braked S700 (or S690) channel section columns failing by flexural buckling about the minor principal axes to the design of their S960 counterparts. The assessment results indicated that (i) the existing European code leads to overall conservative and scattered design flexural buckling resistances, especially for those relatively short and intermediate press-braked S960 UHSS channel section columns with failure in the ‘reverse C’ orientation, and (ii) the North American specification and Australian/New Zealand standard result in a higher degree of design accuracy and consistency than the European code, but with many over-predicted flexural buckling resistances for press-braked S960 UHSS channel section short and intermediate columns failing in the ‘C’ orientation.

Abstract: Dynamic measurements under known moving loads yield a novel procedure for the elastic modulus assessment of existing concrete bridges. The bridge deck is modelled as a single-span, simply supported Euler–Bernoulli beam excited by a travelling force. The elastic modulus assessment derives from an Ordinary Least Square procedure with a Bayesian uncertainty estimation, obtained by approximating the known term of the governing equations due to the travelling force with a square wave signal. The authors validated the procedure on six full-scale concrete girders of the A24 motorway in Italy and compared the results to the values obtained via in situ static load tests and further tests on concrete specimens. The procedure represents a straightforward test devised for supporting the drafting of quality control plans and the prioritization of the interventions.

Abstract: Batten to rafter connections in light framed timber housing can be vulnerable to wind loading, and failures of these connections are one of the more common failure modes seen in post windstorm damage surveys. Such failures often occur in a progressive or cascading manner resulting in the loss of a large section of the roof envelope. These progressive failures of batten to rafter connections are a complex process influenced by the pressure fluctuations on the roof surface, the response of individual connections and the behaviour of the structural system as a whole. This study presents a method for examining load redistribution and progressive failure behaviour of batten to rafter connections in light framed structures. Nonlinear time history analyses were performed using a finite element model using fluctuating pressures determined from a wind tunnel study and connection properties determined from laboratory testing of connections under dynamic loads.

Abstract: This paper aims at analyzing the effects of soil non-homogeneity on the dynamic behavior of piled structures. In order to fulfil this objective a procedure based on a substructuring model, which includes soil-structure interaction effects, is used to compute the dynamic response of slender and non-slender structures supported on several pile group configurations embedded in four different linear-elastic Gibson soil profiles. A numerical model based on the integral formulation of the elastodynamic problem and Green’s functions for the layered half space is used for the purpose of determining the foundation dynamic response in terms of impedances and kinematic interaction factors. The results obtained in terms of structural base shear force for each one of the variable-with-depth soil profiles are compared to those computed for an equivalent homogeneous soil. A significant influence of the soil profile on the structural harmonic response to seismic waves is observed in terms of maximum shear force at the base of the structure. The homogeneous assumption when modelling depth-varying soil profiles yields, in many cases, non-conservative results when predicting the structural dynamic behavior.

Abstract: Masonry structures are often characterized by complex, non-planar geometries. This is also the case for historical and monumental structures. Here we investigate the dynamic behaviour of non-standard, curvilinear masonry geometries, such as vaults, subjected to blast loading. We use the Discrete Element Method (DEM) for modelling the dynamic structural response to explosions. The approach allows considering the detailed mechanical and geometrical characteristics of masonry, as well as the inherent coupling between the in- and out-of-plane motion. The proposed modelling approach is validated with existing experimental tests in the case of planar masonry geometries, walls. The DEM model well captures the dynamic response of the system and the form of failure within the masonry structure. Then the response of a curved masonry structure subjected to blast loading is investigated. The influence of various micro-mechanical parameters, such as the dilatancy angle, the tensile strength and the cohesion of the masonry joints on the overall dynamic structural response of the system is explored. The effect of the size of the building blocks is also studied. Finally, the common DEM assumption of rigid blocks is assessed through detailed comparisons with simulations involving deformable blocks.

Abstract: Retrofitting reinforced concrete (RC) column by conventional fibre reinforced polymers (FRPs) can enhance the seismic performance to a limited level due to the small straining capacity and brittle failure of FRP. Existing findings have substantiated that the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) FRP with large rupture strain (LRS) (e.g., greater than 5%) are regarded as preferable to conventional FRP concerning enhancing the ductility of retrofitted RC columns. This paper experimentally evaluates the enhancement in seismic performance of corroded RC columns contributed by LRS-FRP strengthening based on testing of ten RC columns. The main test variables are the corrosion ratio of longitudinal reinforcement, axial force ratio, thickness of LRS-FRP and boundary condition. The seismic performance is systematically evaluated, including crack pattern, failure mode, lateral load resistance, hysteretic response, energy-dissipation capacity, stiffness degradation, ductility and strain responses of wrapped LRS-FRP. The results indicate that corrosion results in significant performance degradation in member strength and ductility. Notably, the failure mode of un-retrofitted corroded columns changes from typical flexural failure to shear-compression failure when the axial load ratio increases from 0.2 to 0.4, which case is prevented by LRS-FRP strengthening so that the retrofitted corroded column eventually experiences ductile flexural failure under larger axial load ratio. Moreover, LRS-FRP retrofitting remarkably improves the ductility and energy dissipation capacity of corroded RC columns compared with the un-retrofitted counterparts.

Abstract: Inclined cables used in bridges or other infrastructures are vulnerable to unsteady wind-induced loads producing moderate- to large-amplitude vibration that may result in damage or failure of the cables, resulting in catastrophic failure of the structure they secure. In the present study, wind-induced response of an inclined smooth cable was studied through wind tunnel measurements using a flexible cable model for a better understanding of the vibration characteristics of structural cables in atmospheric boundary layer wind. For this purpose, in-plane and out-of-plane responses of a sagged and a non-sagged flexible cable were recorded by four accelerometers. Four cases with different yaw and inclination angles of a cable with approximate sag ratios of 1/10 were studied to investigate the wind directionality effect on its excitation mode(s) and response amplitude. Cable tension was also measured during all experiments to assess the correlation of wind speed, excitation vibration mode, and natural frequency of the cable with change in cable tension. Additionally, two inclined cables with no sag were tested to determine the influence of sag of a cable on its vibration characteristics. In the second part of this study, a series of finite element analyses were conducted to predict the wind-induced aerodynamic damping of an inclined bridge cable. Experimental results showed that excitation mode(s) of a cable depend on wind speed, inclination angle, and sag ratio and cable tension. First, second, and third vibration modes were observed at a low wind speed for different test cases, whereas higher vibration modes were observed to contribute to the cable response at high wind speeds. Moreover, it was seen that the cable tension significantly increased with wind speed resulting in increased value of the excited natural frequency. Numerical results obtained through finite element analysis of an inclined full-scale cable showed that the criteria that are based on section models can underestimate the critical reduced velocity for dry cable galloping.

Abstract: The problem of reducing the damage due to seismic loads in engineering structures by means of tuned mass dampers (TMDs) is addressed. Differently from previous studies focused on linear or geometrically nonlinear TMDs, the present work is concerned with a device that exhibits a hysteretic restoring force with pinching. A numerical TMD optimization is carried out so as to ensure optimal energy transfer from the main structure to the TMD for various seismic ground motion severities. The effectiveness of the vibration protection strategy is discussed for two different structural systems, i.e. a multi-story steel building with a purely elastoplastic behavior and a masonry building that exhibits stiffness and strength degradation. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the hysteretic TMD can achieve a meaningful average reduction of the root mean square (RMS) displacement of the steel structure between 40% (for 1% mass ratio) and 60% (for 5% mass ratio). Various seismic records related to soil types and seismic intensity levels different from those considered at the design stage, or unpredictable variations of the main system stiffness up to 10%, are shown to have rather limited influence on the TMD performance. It is shown that a classical linear TMD can attain a protection level comparable to that of the hysteretic TMD only at the expense of much higher mass ratios. Compared to the multi-story structure, the performance of the hysteretic TMD in a masonry building is still satisfactory although degraded, i.e. by about 15% in terms of RMS displacement. The performance is better than that of a classical linear absorber for very small mass ratios, especially for mid- or high-intensity seismic ground motions. The greater robustness of the hysteretic TMD performance for a wide range of seismic ground motions is due to its softening-type backbone, which can be optimized to accommodate the frequency changes that engineering structures typically undergo under seismic excitation. The role of the pinching in the performance of the hysteretic TMD is clarified.

Abstract: An experimental program, investigating the potential of using multi-directional fibre-reinforced polymers (FRPs) as a strengthening option for glulam beams when subjected to blast loading, was undertaken. A total of ten different retrofit configurations were investigated and compared to the behaviour of unretrofitted glulam members. In general, the use of multi-directional GFRP contributed to significant performance enhancement, where ductility ratios in the range of 2.3–3.6 were obtained. The use of bidirectional GFRP fabrics localized the damage in the wood section to a small area, and provided confinement which helped delay the failure of the retrofitted specimen. The FRP fabrics also contributed to an increase in wood ultimate tensile failure strain. A two-step approach was proposed to predict the resistance function of the retrofitted specimens. The model predicted the peak resistance and deflection at peak resistance reasonably well. The approach was able to predict the ultimate failure deflection when the experimental ductility ratios were used. An approach for design using a lower-bound ductility ratio was proposed.

Abstract: This paper studies the characteristics of square concrete-filled double-skin steel tubular (CFDST) short columns with inner circular steel tube by performing a series of nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis. The precise definitions of the behavior of the material are the initial requirement of numerical modeling. The existing models for predicting the behavior of the concrete core confined by the circular tube are not suitable since the mechanism of the concrete confinement in square composite columns is different from that of the circular ones. Also, ignoring the confinement effects on improving the concrete strength may lead to conservative results. In this paper, the confinement effects provided by the steel tubes on the concrete core in square CFDST columns are taken into account in the concrete constitutive model. The verified FE model is utilized to investigate the effects of important parameters on the ultimate axial strength, energy absorption capacity, ductility, and interaction performance of CFDST columns. A new design equation is suggested based on stress distribution over the concrete cross-section. It is shown that material properties and dimensions of composite columns can highly affect their performance. Also, the thickness of the inner tube must be controlled to prevent its premature failure. Validation of the design equation shows that it leads to the satisfactory predictions of the ultimate strengths of square CFDST short columns under axial loading.

Abstract: This paper presents experimental and numerical investigations on the vibrational serviceability performance of novel adhesive free engineered wood products (AFEWPs), namely adhesive free laminated timber beams (AFLB) and adhesive free cross-laminated timber panels (AFCLT), assembled through thermo-mechanically compressed wood dowels (CWD). The laminations composing the AFEWPs are made of oak timber while the CWD are made of spruce. The experimental modal analyses were carried out under free-free conditions using a hammer impact. Natural frequencies, mode shapes, and damping ratios were assessed experimentally. In addition, similar glued beams made of oak timber (conventional glulam) were manufactured and tested for comparison purpose. A predictive 3D FE model was developed and validated by comparison against experimental data and then used to predict the vibrational behavior of a realistic flooring system made with AFCLT panel and measuring 4.5 m × 5.5 m. The predicted FE results were discussed with regard to the Eurocode 5 vibrational serviceability design requirements showing acceptable vibrational performance. The variability level of the results for the AFEWPs is also studied and discussed.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling the evolution of structural systems throughout time, especially by considering its cumulative damage, is a key point for risk decision making. This concept is of extreme importance for design criteria definition, operational policies, robust life-cycle cost estimations and real time-dependent vulnerability assessment. In particular, an important objective of these type of analyses, is the estimation of the structure lifetime distribution and its corresponding mean time to failure (MTTF). However, analytic solutions of these two main concepts are not an easy task. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new approaches that can be used to better approximate the lifetime of structures in an accurate and useful way for engineering purposes. Within this context, the objective of this research work is to present a methodology to estimate the lifetime distribution of structures, and the derived properties of a structural system located in a seismic region. Mainshocks are modelled as a homogeneous Poisson process with constant mean rate of occurrence. The model, assumes that the deterioration of a given structure is mainly controlled by the cumulative damage generated by a set of consecutive earthquake events in a certain period of time. This approach can be easily implemented and provides a good estimation of the lifetime distribution of a structure, without venturing into the mathematical complexities of an analytic solution but retaining the main features of the system performance. Finally, an illustrative practical case at a real site is provided.

Abstract: An important application of fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites in structural engineering is to confine concrete. In contrast to actively confined concrete, the stress-strain curve of FRP-confined concrete can have a second ascending branch when sufficient confinement is applied. Numerous analytical models have been proposed to predict the axial stress–strain behaviour of FRP-confined concrete. These models can be classified into two categories: (a) analysis-oriented models and (b) design-oriented models. In this paper, a 3-dimensional geometrical approach is proposed to interpret the general theory of analysis-oriented models based on three general equations. This approach provides an intuitive perspective to understand the analysis-oriented models and the mechanism of FRP-confined concrete. With this approach, a systematic methodology for calibrating analysis-oriented models is demonstrated, and the parameters in design-oriented models are justified. This methodology can also be applied to build analysis-oriented models for other concrete-type materials.

Abstract: Torsional behavior of RC members is dependent on various factors including the amount of rebar, concrete strength, member cross-section, depth to width ratio, and concrete cover. Although there is an enormous amount of knowledge on the effect of the above-mentioned factors on torsional behavior, studies pertaining to the effect of concrete cover is scarce. In the current study, a total of nine RC beams with clear concrete cover thickness ranging from 16 mm to 46 mm were experimentally investigated for pure torsion. Coupled with concrete cover depth, the effect of transverse reinforcement spacing and compressive strength of concrete were systematically investigated. Moreover, the experimental results were used to examine the prediction of commonly used codes including ACI, CSA, and Eurocode. To have a holistic view, the reliability of existing prediction graphical methods developed based on the well-known and accepted theories of MCFT and STM as well as recently developed empirical equations were also examined. The experimental results indicated the presence of relatively larger cover greatly affects both the ultimate capacity and overall torsional behavior of RC members. When compared with the experiments, ACI provides a highly conservative estimate, particularly with the increase of the cover depth. On the contrary, CSA and Eurocode provide unsafe predictions. Although the prediction is on the unsafe side, CSA and Eurocode gave a consistent prediction with smaller scatter for the different concrete depths. The prediction of the models based on the graphical methods and the empirical equation were also found to be unsafe with the effect becoming highly pronounced for cases with relatively large concrete cover. Overall, the experimental investigation showed the thickness of cover concrete has a significant effect on the pre and post-peak torsional behavior of RC members.

Abstract: Monopole towers are slender structures usually employed for telecommunication, for meteorological measurements or for massive lighting poles. The structure is made-up of a vertical cantilever column constrained to the ground by a massive foundation. It is generally recognized that such slender structures, can be very sensitive to wind effects due to their dynamic characteristics. The paper focuses the attention on a prototype of a gyroscopic device conceived as an active stabilizer of such slender structures subjected to dynamic forces as wind or heart-quakes. In the present paper, a mathematical model of the gyroscopic device installed on a typical tower model has been implemented aiming to study its dynamic behavior. Free vibrations of the dynamic-model were analyzed in order to assess the effectiveness of the proposed apparatus. Results show that the use of a gyroscopic stabilizer allows, as expected, for an effective stiffening of the monopole tower and for a remarkable increase of its damping ratio with a consequent improvement of its dynamic performances.

Abstract: Previous research has shown that nonemulative (jointed) precast walls with unbonded posttensioning can achieve superior seismic performance (e.g., self-centering) compared to conventional monolithic cast-in-place reinforced concrete walls. However, the progression of significant damage and failure in nonemulative precast walls is through the yielding of ductile steel reinforcing bars (referred to as energy dissipating bars) followed by the crushing of concrete at the wall toes, greatly limiting the ability to repair these walls after a major earthquake. In this paper, a nonemulative precast wall system with replaceable, external buckling restrained plates (BRPs) for energy dissipation, and steel jackets for confinement of the concrete at the wall base is investigated through reversed-cyclic lateral loading tests. Four precast wall specimens with varying cross-sectional area of the BRPs and number of horizontal joints were tested and compared against a monolithic cast-in-place reinforced concrete wall. The precast walls exhibited no significant unrepairable tensile or compressive damage with increasinglateral strength up to 4% drift, showing advantages over the cast-in-place wall and non-jacketed precast walls in previous research. With out-of-plane buckling restrained, the BRPs yielded in tension and compression, providing the precast walls with desirable energy dissipation. To highlight the reparability of the precast wall system, one of the specimens was repaired after being subjected to a complete cyclic loading history up to 4% drift. The repair was done by replacing the damaged BRPs, after which the wall was re-tested. The repaired wall restored most of its original energy dissipation, lateral stiffness, and strength, with limited cumulativedamage in the wall. In general, the proposed precast wall system with buckling restrained plates is desirable for seismic regions, offering excellent reparability and seismic resilience.

Abstract: The Brunelleschi herringbone pattern was certainly known by the Sangallo in the 16th century, who developed their own self-balanced construction technology for masonry domes based on the cross-herringbone spiraling pattern. Such technology was used for over one century in Italy to build masonry domes without shoring and formwork. However today it is not well known how this cross-herringbone spiraling pattern enables equilibrium states of self-balancing masonry domes. Therefore, in this study we demonstrate how this pattern permits equilibrium states of an octagonal masonry dome using two analysis approaches (i.e. Discrete Element Model and Limit State Analysis). The Discrete Element Model analysis has been performed to show the existence of the plate-bande resistance within the pattern. Even in the construction stages, these plate-bande resistance systems are capable of preventing sliding and overturning of the masonry dome. With the global self-balanced static equilibrium state proven, a Limit State Analysis is then adopted to estimate a possible thrust configuration needed to achieve equilibrium of the plate-bandes and the whole dome at each construction stage. It is shown that the value of the mortar friction has little influence on the static behavior of the dome. The study of the cross-herringbone spiraling pattern does not merely serve historical or conservation purposes. It has practical applications for the development of dry self-balanced robotic masonry construction technologies, particularly suited for unmanned aerial vehicles.

Abstract: The key to the research of progressive structural collapse is to perform an in-depth investigation into the structural collapse mechanism at the onset of structural component failure due to accidental events and the demand of progressive collapse resistance for the remaining substructures. According to existing research findings, both beams and floors are important anti-progressive structural collapse components. However, the most common available methods for analyzing progressive collapse adopt the empirical coefficient assumption, which lacks the theoretical basis and neglects the contribution of floor resistance. This assumption leads to discrepancies between design and practice and causes unnecessary construction costs. This paper builds the resistance-deformation theoretical framework for the entire progressive collapse of framed structures under an interior column failure scenario based on yield line theory, where the contribution of floor resistance in the structural collapse is taken into consideration. By comparing experimental results to a finite element model, the simplified models are validated from aspects of both experimental and numerical simulations. To further validate the model, a set of beam-slab progressive collapse tests were designed in accordance with the Code for Design of Concrete Structures. Finally, simplified models accounting for floor resistance in the load-carrying and deformation capacities of RC structures to resist progressive collapse were developed to provide a quantitative estimation for practical applications in the design of frame structures.

Abstract: To explore the shear behaviour of high strength bolted connectors in steel-SFRC composite beams, push-out tests were carried out on 18 steel-fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) specimens and 4 normal concrete (NC) specimens. The failure modes, ultimate shear strength, load-slip response as well as the shear stiffness of the tested specimens were determined accordingly. During the experiment, two failure modes that involved bolt shear failure and concrete splitting failure were observed in both NC and SFRC specimens. As the bolt-to-hole clearances of specimens were infilled, the slip plateau at the early loading stage therefor were avoided and the corresponding shear stiffness of bolted connectors increased as well. Compared to NC specimens, the extension of cracks on SFRC slabs were limited and the width of cracks efficiently decreased because of the addition of steel fibre in concrete. The ultimate shear strength of the bolted connectors in steel-SFRC composite beams was about 21.2% higher than that of the bolted connectors in steel-NC composite beams, with the volume percentage of steel fibre in concrete being approximate 1.0%. The applied pretension on bolted connectors had a significant effect on the shear stiffness of bolted connectors, but almost had no effect on the ultimate shear strength. The ultimate shear strength of bolted connectors increased with the increase of concrete compressive strength, bolt shank area and bolt tensile strength. Finite element models, which confirmed by the tested results, were also employed to perform the parametrical analysis involved in concrete compressive strength, as well as bolt pretension, and diameter and tensile strength. Upon the experimental and independent FE results, practical calculation formulas were further proposed, which can properly estimate the ultimate shear strength as well as the load-slip curves of high strength bolted connectors in steel-SFRC composite beams.

Abstract: In an H-steel-to-timber composite beam, a joint connected by self-tapping screws perpendicular to the steel flange may have problems such as inconvenient construction and a limitation of the embedded depth of the screws due to the thickness of the timber panel. This study proposes a steel-to-timber composite (STC) joint with inclined screws. Push-out tests with double shear planes are carried out for 10 groups of specimens, in which each group includes 3 identical specimens, and the load-slip behaviour and failure modes are analysed. Test results demonstrate that longer self-tapping screws can be used in the STC joint with inclined screws to increase the embedded depth in the timber to obtain a higher shear capacity and that this does cause a drop in shear stiffness. For joints with inclined screws, the use of tapper washers is proposed. The test results show that the shear stiffness of a joint with inclined screws is significantly improved through the use of tapper washers and is approximately the same as that of a joint connected by screws perpendicular to the flange, but the shear capacity is not similarly affected. By analysing the causes of shear failure and comparing subsequent test results, it is found that the screws with a sufficiently long smooth shank should be selected to be used in a joint with inclined screws. Thus, the transition from the smooth shank to the threaded shank is away from the steel-to-timber shear plane, and shear failure can be prevented to obtain good ductility. Furthermore, compared to the joint with a single row of screws, the joint with multiple rows of screws has a similar stiffness, but the shear capacity is reduced by 10.5%. Finally, the calculation method proposed by Eurocode 5 can accurately and safely estimate the shear capacity of the steel-to-glulam screwed joints tested in this paper and accurately predicts the failure modes.

Abstract: A relatively new prestressed concrete composite slab with precast inverted T-shaped ribbed panels (CSPRPs) is proposed in this paper. To study the influence of the three different rib forms on the flexural behavior of the CSPRP, a series of bending tests on six full-scale specimens and numerical studies were conducted. The test results indicate that the static behaviors including the cracking load, ultimate bearing capacity, and deflection are similar for the CSPRPs with different rib forms and the (precast and cast-in-place) concrete layers can work compositely. Furthermore, an extensive parametric study was carried out to investigate the static behavior of CSPRP considering the variations of prestress ratios, prestress degrees, spans, concrete strengths, and contact degrees. Lastly, the comparison of the theoretical values with the test and parametric study results indicates the formulas proposed in this paper are accurate and suitable for practical designs.

Abstract: The conventional assembled monolithic grouted sleeve connection of column–column joints continues to require in situ grouting, which has certain disadvantages, including the necessity of wet construction. Compared with cast-in-situ columns, its seismic performance is relatively insufficient in terms of deformation and energy dissipation capacity. In this paper, a new type of precast concrete column–column joint and its corresponding column base joint with a steel jacket for confining the concrete core and bolted flange plate is proposed to achieve rapid erection. Six specimens are tested at a high axial compression ratio and cyclic reversed loading, including three precast column–column joints with bolted flange plate, one column base joint with bolted flange plate, one grouted sleeve connection joint, and one cast-in-situ column. This study focuses on the effects of the ratio of longitudinal reinforcement to the gap between the steel jacket and upper concrete on seismic performances. Test results indicate that this new joint is reliable, and all failure modes involve the flexural failure of the precast upper column. The influence of tensile reinforcement on the out-of-plane deformation of the flange plate is minimal. Compared to the cast-in-situ column, the column with a flange plate connection has a more gradual crack development, a slightly higher resistance, an improved ductility, and a better energy dissipation capacity. With the increase in longitudinal reinforcement ratio, the confining effect of the steel jacket on the concrete core becomes more distinct. The gap between the steel jacket and upper concrete could effectively delay the compressive damage on the concrete surface. Finally, considering the confining effect of the steel jacket, the flexural capacity of the proposed precast column is determined using the fiber model. The predicted results approximate the test values and are all within the safe range.

Abstract: In bolted composite connections design, staggered arrangements might offer a good area usage especially for structural elements with a small width. In this research, experimental and numerical works were employed to study the composite-steel double lapped joints with staggered bolts arrangement under static loads. Staggered bolt arrangement was studied with different bolt diameters and numbers. The predictions of developed models were compared to the experimental results and a good correlation was evaluated. The experimental study shows that the side distance in the staggered bolted joint has a significant influence on the maximum load due to the out-of-plane rotation. Simulation of the experimental work shows that this out-of-plane rotation produces a horizontal force on the direction causing early failure for the joint. A parametric study was performed to investigate the effect of bolt numbers and diameters. It was found that the number of bolts has a more significant effect on increasing joint failure load than the bolt diameter. In all cases, the first bolt from the composite plate side has the maximum force, therefore, the first damage happened under this bolt. Considering the axial applied load direction as a reference direction, high perpendicular to parallel forces ratio was evaluated on the bolts of the staggered joint. It is recommended to consider this force during the design of the laminate. Furthermore, the staggered bolt arrangement was found to cause a significant out-of-plane bending which is recommended to be taken into consideration.

Abstract: A dowel-pinned anchorage in granite cladding has been widely used in modern granite cladding systems. However, current studies on the breaking loads of dowel-pinned connections are limited, and the damage behavior is not yet clear as a result of insufficient experimental studies. In accordance with current code provisions, monotonic static loading tests were carried out to investigate the breaking load and failure modes of a dowel-pinned cladding connection. The specimens were 200 × 200 × 30 mm granite panel with holes drilled in the middle of each side for steel pins with three different diameters, that is, 5 mm, 6 mm, and 7 mm. The results show that when using the 5 mm steel dowel pin, the steel pin yielded with a certain plastic deformation prior to the V-shape fracture of the granite near the dowel hole. When using the 7 mm and 8 mm steel pins, the U-shape fracture of the granite panel occurred first. Then only slight bending deformations of the steel pins were observed. The experimental breaking load was compared to the computational results following the formula recommended in the literature. A conceptual loading skeleton curve was developed to illustrate the damage progress of the connection. It revealed the load redistribution mechanism in the connection in a representative manner with which the calculated stress in the steel pin is corresponded to the experimental breaking load. This study is helpful for understanding the damage behavior of the novel connection in stone claddings.

Abstract: This paper presents a study on the structural behavior of traditional raw earthen masonry (adobe). Shear behavior and tensile strength are analyzed from diagonal compression and splitting tests. Consistent results of the tensile strength are obtained from splitting and diagonal compression tests. The assumption of a pure shear strain state in diagonal compression tests is validated from the analysis of the full strain field measured by using a Digital Image Correlation system. Different estimators for the shear modulus are analyzed. The authors recommend a tangent modulus value between 1/3 and 2/3 of the shear strength for structural design purpose. Results from previous research works are compared and analyzed. Values of tensile strength, shear modulus and the ratio tensile/compressive strength are in good agreement.

Abstract: The fatigue performance of steel-fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) beams with tensile steel bars of 500 MPa yielding strength (HRB500) was investigated through flexural tests. One control beam was tested to determine the ultimate capacity on being subjected to static loading, and eight beams with variable stress levels and fiber contents were tested subjected to fatigue loading. Test results indicated that the fatigue life of the beams decreased with increasing stress level and increased with fiber content. For an SFRC beam with 1% fiber content, its fatigue life increased by twice compared with that of non-fiber-reinforced concrete beams, thereby, confirming the fact that adding steel fibers into concrete can enhance fatigue life significantly. With the addition of steel fibers, the cracking patterns of the beams improved and deflections decreased during fatigue loading. Furthermore, the stress range of the tensile steel bar decreased with increasing fiber content, and slippage did not occur between the tensile steel bar and concrete owing to adequate anchorage. An effective moment of inertia method that considers the effects of steel fibers was used to calculate the stresses of tensile steel bars in the first loading cycle; subsequently, an empirical expression to calculate the SFRC strain in compression zone under fatigue loading is established. Finally, a prediction model of stress range for the tensile steel bar of SFRC beams under fatigue loading is proposed and further validated through the results of tests on 19 SFRC beams.

Abstract: Steel reinforced concrete (SRC) composite members, in which a steel shape is encased in a reinforced concrete section, are widely used in high-rise buildings in seismic-prone areas, and the accurate shear strength prediction of SRC shear-critical members is still under investigation by researchers and code-writers. The current code-based design method is acceptable for determining the shear strength of SRC members because of the feasibility and simplification compared with other complicated calculation models. Nevertheless, the code-based design method is usually established on the basis of the strength superposition method, indicating that the overall shear strength of a SRC member is obtained as the sum of the shear strength of the steel shape and that of the reinforced concrete. Although the strength superposition method is simple and feasible, the shear strengths of these two parts usually cannot reach the corresponding peak point at the same time, which may lead to an unsafe result. This research presents a theoretical model for predicting the shear strengths of SRC deep beams and SRC short columns. In this model, the concept of strength superposition is applied, and the shear strength of the steel shape and that of the reinforced concrete part are calculated using comprehensive models and related according to the shear deformation. Finally, the proposed model is compared with other calculation methods from codes Eurocode 4, AISC 360, JGJ 138 and YB 9082 using the available test data consisting of 63 SRC short columns and 57 SRC deep beams, and it can be concluded that the proposed model is capable of calculating the shear strengths of SRC short columns and SRC deep beams with sufficient accuracy and safety.

Abstract: A parametric study was carried out to investigate the torsional response of structures isolated with the Triple Friction Pendulum (TFP) system with building properties such as uncoupled torsional to lateral frequency ratio, Ωs, building slenderness, and mass and stiffness eccentricities. A simplified model of a parametric multistory structure and a small deformation model of the TFP, but with the ability to capture uplift, were used to perform parametric 3D non-linear dynamic analyses. The input ground motions were 20 Chilean records selected using a conditional mean spectrum. Response history results showed that uplift in the devices occurs in structures with large mass eccentricity, and in some extreme cases, normal force values in the TFPs may be as large as 6 times the nominal average gravitational load in each isolator. Torsional envelope response results also show that mass eccentric systems may undergo larger normalized edge amplification factors relative to stiffness eccentric systems, with values 2.5 and 1.8, respectively, and that torsional balance cannot be achieved naturally. Although rotations are small in magnitude due to seismic isolation, displacement values in resisting planes of the superstructure equidistant from the geometric center of the plan will be different. Moreover, structures with large Ωs present correlation values between response histories of torsion and translation measured at the geometric center of the plan near one, as well as values above zero for different Ωs and plan eccentricity, which implies no torsional control in the weak sense. It is concluded that parameter Ωs strongly influences the torsional amplification values computed herein.

Abstract: The bond strength between precast concrete and cast in place ultra high performance concrete (UHPC) plays a significant role in the application of UHPC as a filling material for bridge connections or an overlay in the rehabilitation of bridges. This study examined several factors that affect the interfacial bond strength in order to cover wide range of conditions in the field. It investigated the effect of type of concrete substrate (normal and high strength concrete), aggregate type (crushed stone and river stone), surface preparation (dry and saturated surface dry), UHPC age, and testing method. The experimental program was conducted in two phases. In Phase I, the effects of concrete strength, UHPC age and type of aggregate were explored using direct tension test method, while in Phase II, the effect of surface preparation was investigated using four different test methods. The results indicate that the UHPC age after casting resulted in a marginal increase in the bond strength for normal strength concrete (NSC) and a significant increase in the bond strength of the high strength concrete (HSC) specimens. The HSC specimens, however, showed slightly higher bond strength than the NSC after 7 and 28 days of curing. Moisture at the interface increased the bond strength by 3%, 22.7% and 2.3% using direct tension, bi-shear and slant shear, respectively. Except for bi-shear test, the saturated surface dry (SSD) surface preparation reduced the variability of test results and the likelihood of the interfacial failure. The cohesion and shear friction coefficients were determined using several methods. The minimum cohesion value was 2.78 MPa (0.4 ksi) for dry and SSD conditions, while the friction coefficients were1.33 and 1.32 for dry and the SSD specimens, respectively. The minimum bond strength under tension was 3.39 MPa (0.49 ksi) and 3.49 MPa (0.51 ksi) for dry and SSD conditions, respectively. Both dry and SSD surface preparation resulted in superior bond and friction that exceeds the value reported by code provisions.

Abstract: The impact and post-impact behaviours of H-shaped steel members are investigated experimentally and numerically in this paper. The drop-hammer impact tests and the axial compression tests after impact were firstly performed on thirteen specimens, in which two boundary conditions and four impact energies (drop height ranged from 1.04 m to 2.50 m) were used. Experimental results such as failure patterns, impact force–time histories, permanent deformations and post-impact axial load-lateral deflection curves were presented. Subsequently, finite element models were established using ABAQUS software. The impact test and the axial compression test after impact were reproduced using the explicit and implicit algorithms in ABAQUS, respectively. Finally, case studies were carried out using the validated FE models to assess the residual load-carrying capacities of impact-damaged H-shaped steel members in industrial plants. The results showed that the boundary condition had an influence on the failure pattern and impact force response during impact. Within the parameter range of this work, the residual load-carrying capacity of H-shaped steel members was primarily affected by the global deformation at the mid-height induced by impact.

Abstract: Debonding of fiber-reinforced composites can limit the increase of strength that a reinforced concrete (RC) beam can achieve due to the addition of the external layer of reinforcement provided by the composite. Small-scale direct shear tests can help understand the debonding phenomenon. However, researchers have debated for decades whether the results of direct shear tests can be used to predict the strain level at which the composite would fail in strengthened beams. This paper is the first systematic attempt to address this issue. A database of RC beam flexural tests and of direct shear tests that feature externally bonded polypara-phenylene-benzo-bisoxazole (PBO) fiber-reinforced cementitious matrix (FRCM) composite is compiled. For the beam tests, two methods are employed to determine the strain in the composite at failure due to debonding, referred to herein as the cross-sectional analysis method and the ΔM method, and the results are compared with those of direct shear tests. The relationship between the effective strain in the FRCM when composite action is lost and the debonding strain in direct shear tests is critically discussed taking into account what is prescribed by current design guidelines. The limitations of the cross-sectional analysis method to determine the effective strain are also highlighted.

Abstract: The safety of scaffold systems during construction is vital to prevent failures with catastrophic consequences. Engineering practice in the scaffolding industry, however, does not have a rational structural reliability basis as that used for buildings and bridges. The implementation of design clauses for scaffold systems in the current standards partially relies on judgement suffering from the lack of data. With this regard, a reliability-based limit state design approach is developed in this study, making full use of the advanced finite element (FE) method and the recently accumulated statistical data of scaffolding resistance and construction loads. A stochastic finite element method is used to obtain the probabilistic characteristics of the ultimate load-carrying capacities of typical scaffolding frames, accounting for the uncertainties associated with structural geometry, material and stiffness properties. The latest construction load survey data is utilized. System reliability assessment is then performed to develop new design criteria which are consistent with generally accepted structural reliability targets.

Abstract: This paper presents the results of tests for possible stiffness changes in bent reinforced concrete elements exposed to simultaneous action of load and high temperature. The above issue plays a critical role in the advanced analysis of complex RC structures subjected to fire. In order to examine this issue, an experimental study of 24 full-size RC beams was performed. All beams were divided into 8 series according to 3 factors: (1) the cross-section zone exposed to high temperature – tension or compression zone, (2) reinforcement ratio – 0.44 or 1.13%, (3) load level in reference to ultimate load capacity at room temperature – 50 or 70%. The pure bending part of the beam was heated. Stiffness changes estimated on the basis of deflection measurement. The cross-section stiffness of the beam with the heated tension zone decreases rapidly at the initial heating stage. A decrease of 60–80% in cross-section stiffness is observed at reinforcement temperature of 200–300 °C. When reinforcement temperature is about 500 °C, the cross-section stiffness may be only 10–15% of its value at room temperature. It has also been found that the model recommended in Eurocode 1992-1-2 characterizing mechanical properties of tensile steel in high temperature may be used for the adequate prediction of stiffness decrease in the cross-section with the heated tension zone. It can be assumed that during heating the stiffness of cross-sections with the heated compression zone will remain approximately constant for some time. It will only start to decrease when the strain of concrete exposed simultaneously to load and high temperature begins to exceed its free thermal strain. This paper presents a simplified method to estimate the cross-section stiffness in bent reinforced concrete elements with the heated tension or compression zone.

Abstract: A steel–timber composite (STC) column made of H-shaped steel and glulam is proposed in this paper. This STC column is constructed by wrapping the H-shaped steel with the adhesive-applied glulam, which provides confinement to reduce the buckling behaviour of the inner steel. Six STC specimens with lengths of 1100 mm, 1700 mm and 2300 mm were studied using an axial compression test in comparison to three steel and three timber specimens. The distinctive behaviours of the specimens were identified, including the failure mode, load–axial displacement relationship, load–lateral deflection relationship and load–axial strain response. The results demonstrated that the mechanical properties of the STC column are significantly affected by column length. The interaction mechanism between the steel and timber materials was evaluated by analysing the yield strain and the ductility coefficient. The composite effect of the STC column was also discussed by comparing the average strengths. Furthermore, the load-carrying capacity calculation formula including parameter selection of the STC column when yielding was proposed.

Abstract: Damage models are fundamental elements within probabilistic frameworks, such as Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering (PBEE), for the seismic assessment of RC structures. For bridges, in specific, there are not many available experimental results for the characterization of damage in the RC columns hence the numerical counterpart acquires particular relevance. In this paper, via Monte Carlo simulation and comparison with complementary experimental results, a damage model consisting of a library of median and logarithmic dispersion values for curvature ductility, displacement ductility and drift, describing the probability of reaching a particular damage limit state are generated as a function of key parameters of circular RC bridge columns. Four damage limit states are considered: slight, moderate, extensive and complete. Simplified relationships based on the full datasets are proposed for easier implementation. The proposed damage models can be used for threshold identification and economic loss assessment in performance-based earthquake engineering of RC bridges.

Abstract: The effect of the shear span-to-depth (a/d) ratio on the shear behavior of steel reinforced grout (SRG)-strengthened reinforced concrete (RC) beams is experimentally investigated. Four critical shear spans corresponding to a/d ratios of 1.60, 2.10, 2.60, and 3.10, representing a range for deep to slender beams were considered. In addition, the effect of the steel fabric density of SRG composites was also explored. Twelve beams were cast in four series of three specimens each. The experimental results demonstrated the strengthening efficacy of SRG for deficient beams in shear. The SRG strengthening enhanced the overall capacity of the beams by more than 130% with an average of 78%. Moreover, the results confirmed the effect of the a/d ratio on the performance of SRG-strengthened beams. The efficacy of the SRG significantly increased with an increase in a/d ratio in deep beams but deteriorated as a/d ratio increase in slender beams. Finally, an analytical model for predicting the shear capacity of SRG-strengthened beams is proposed that captures the effect of the a/d ratio. The model provides accurate and safe predictions with an average of the ratio of the predicted to experimental shear capacities (Vth/Vex) of 0.99 with a standard deviation of 0.068.

Abstract: To truly reflect the influence on structural seismic response control using viscoelastic dampers with strong nonlinear properties and reduce the cost and difficulty of experimental research, a new user-programmable hybrid simulation platform is developed. The core implementation details of this platform, including the core architecture, software system, and testing setup, are described. To better realize accuracy and stability of the hybrid simulation experiment, methods for solving the equivalent force equilibrium equation for hybrid simulation experiments on viscoelastically damped structures are proposed. Then, the mechanical properties of the experimental substructure (viscoelastic damper) are tested under different temperatures, amplitudes and frequencies, and the mathematical model parameters of the experimental substructure are identified. A seismic response comparison of viscoelastically damped structures obtained by the hybrid simulation experiment and the time history analysis verifies the robustness and reliability of the hybrid simulation platform to test nonlinear systems. Lastly, a series of hybrid simulation experiments for viscoelastically damped structures under different temperatures, seismic intensities and seismic waves are implemented using this hybrid simulation platform for the first time. The experimental results reveal the influence on structural seismic response control by viscoelastic damper under different temperatures, seismic intensities and seismic waves.

Abstract: This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation on the fire behaviour of restrained composite columns made with square concrete filled double-skin and double-tube hollow sections. In the fire resistance tests the columns have been tested for different parameters that may influence their behavior, as for example the type of cross-section, the concrete filling of the tubes (ordinary, high-strength and light-weight concrete), the load level and the stiffness of the surrounding structure to the testing columns. These columns had two concentric steel tubes, where the inner one had approximately half the side of the outer one. The double-tube columns had both tubes filled with concrete and the double-skin ones had only concrete between tubes. As major conclusions, it was observed that the load level had a small influence on the reduction of the critical times but some influence on the reduction of the ultimate collapse times of the tested columns. The stiffness showed an insignificant influence on the critical time but again a higher influence on the ultimate collapse time of the columns being those smaller for the higher stiffness values. The concrete infill showed some influence, presenting the columns with high-strength concrete in the inner tube higher ultimate collapse times than those with ordinary concrete. The use of light-weight concrete between tubes did not show advantages when comparing with the ordinary concrete. The double-tube columns presented in general advantages over the double-skin columns being the ultimate collapse times of the first higher than those of the second.

Abstract: The objective of this experimental study is to assess the effect of new flexural anchorage devices on improving the performance of strengthened reinforced concrete beams in flexure. Six reinforced concrete (RC) beams were prepared and tested, three of which having identical T cross-section and the other three with identical rectangular section. The first specimen in each series was tested as a control beam. The second specimen in each series was strengthened using four layers of flexural CFRP in addition to side GFRP bars. The sidebars were inserted longitudinally into side grooves at the level of primary steel reinforcement to prevent peeling off from the sides. The last specimen in each series was strengthened in flexure using identical four layers of CFRP plus GFRP patches installed longitudinally along both sides of the beam. The beams were tested under four-point bending until failure and the results for each series are evaluated. In addition, the outcome is compared with U-wrap anchorage technique that has been examined by others. It was concluded that using CFRP sheets with both anchorage devices significantly increased the flexural capacity beyond that of unanchored and U-wrap anchored specimens. Quantitatively speaking, T beams anchored with GFRP sidebars and GFRP side patches showed 74% and 58% increase in strength over unanchored strengthened specimens respectively.

Abstract: Many skyscrapers have used the Reinforced Concrete (RC) filled Composite Plate Shear Walls (CPSW). Based on in-plane shear tests on six shear-critical CPSW specimens and a RC shear wall specimen, the behavior of CPSW systems with stud or tie bar connectors, various connector spacings, and various axial compression ratios were reported. In the test program, the Concrete Filled Steel Tubes (CFSTs) are applied for each specimen as boundary elements to simulate the engineering design of CPSW in skyscrapers. This paper presents the test observations, the ultimate capacity, the lateral stiffness, the ductility and the energy dissipation results. Based on the test results, the CPSW specimens with CFST boundary element failed in shear compression failure and the reference RC shear wall failed in shear tension failure. The weld fracture was generally found at boundary element (CFST) in the descending branch. Compared to the RC shear wall, the shear capacity of the CPSW systems were enhanced by 104–129%. The difference between CPSW systems with stud connectors and those with tie bars was insignificant in terms of ultimate capacity. Subsequently, a new database including 38 test specimens was established from the aforementioned test program and available literatures. The database results indicate the compressive capacity of infilled concrete is the dominating factor influencing the shear capacity, instead of the yield capacity of steel. In addition, a design formula for the in-plane ultimate capacity of shear-critical CPSW systems is proposed. Comparisons demonstrated that the proposed model was consistent and exhibited a reasonable level of consistency.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel form of rectangular fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP)-concrete-high strength steel (HSS) hybrid columns referred to as rectangular double-tube concrete columns (DTCCs). These columns consist of a rectangular FRP tube filled with concrete and an elliptical HSS tube as internal reinforcement. The inner elliptical steel tube encloses most of the concrete in the rectangular section and therefore most of the concrete in the section is effectively confined. The high susceptibility of the HSS elliptical tube to local buckling is expected to be suppressed by the confined concrete, leading to full utilization of the high strength of HSS. This paper demonstrates the excellent performance of the new columns due to the above beneficial interactions between different components in the column through an experimental study. In the experimental study, twelve rectangular DTCCs covering different FRP tube thicknesses and aspect ratios were tested under axial compression. Finally, an existing stress–strain model for FRP-confined concrete in rectangular columns is modified to be applicable to the concrete in the new column by accounting for the confinement effect from the inner elliptical HSS tube. It is found that the modified model provides more accurate predictions on the stress–strain curves of confined concrete in the rectangular DTCCs than the original model.

Abstract: The combination of a passive base-isolated (PBI) structure and active structural control (ASC) has been employed in many buildings globally to improve control performance. Conventional approaches have utilized numerical simulations to calculate the maximum response and maximum control force, thereby complicating the design of control systems that satisfy design limitations. To solve this problem, this study extends the gust factor approach to buildings employing a combination of PBI structures and ASC. First, a method to theoretically estimate the mean control force and mean displacement response under along-wind force using only the static equilibrium, without requiring numerical simulations, is presented. Second, estimation methods of the gust factors for the displacement and control force are devised, and numerical verifications are used to validate the estimation methods. Using the estimation method for the mean control force, mean displacement response, and gust factors, the maximum control force and maximum displacement are estimated without using numerical simulations. Finally, a design method for determining the isolated period, isolated damping ratio, and feedback gain that satisfies the restrictions on the maximum control force and maximum displacement response is developed. Subsequently, the design method is validated using a numerical design example.

Abstract: Floating-Slab Tracks (FST) are predominantly used for mitigating railway-induced vibrations where the concrete slab is mounted on soft resilient bearings to provide vibration isolation. This paper presents a research study on the dynamic behavior of a special type of FST used in the recently built subway system in Doha, Qatar. The special FST has a continuous concrete slab with periodic grooves. Therefore, the track can be modeled as a periodic structure with a slab unit having two elements with different cross-sections. Extensive numerical and experimental investigations were conducted on a multi-unit full-scale mockup track representing the special FST. A fast running model based on the Dynamic Stiffness Method was developed and examined, in an initial numerical exercise, against a detailed Finite Element model for a track with a finite length. In the experimental campaign, a test was performed with an impact hammer to identify the actual vibration response of the mockup track. Results from the experimental investigations were then used for model updating of the fast running model. The model updating process was carried out according to an automated hybrid optimization approach that combines genetic algorithms with a local search method. Finally, the updated model was extended to an infinite model to investigate the influence of varying grooves thickness on the dynamic behavior of the special track with infinite length for both bending and torsion scenarios. The investigations suggested that reducing the thickness below 50% of the full thickness of the slab significantly affects the dynamic behavior of the special FST.

Abstract: The analysis and design of self-centering structural systems have attracted substantial attention from researchers for the seismic design of structures. The flag-shaped hysteretic model has been widely used in the design and structural response analysis of self-centering devices. In this research, a modified flag-shaped (MFS) model is proposed to describe the hysteretic characteristics of self-centering energy dissipation (SCED) braces, which are commonly used in self-centering structures. The MFS model comprises three parts: a linear elastic part, a bilinear elastic part, and an elasto-plastic part with a slip zone. The effectiveness of the MFS model is validated based on the results of the quasi-static and hybrid simulation tests available in the literature. Equivalent linearization is carried out on the MFS model for stochastic earthquakes, and closed-form solutions are obtained for the linearized parameters. A one-degree-of-freedom braced system is used to verify the equivalent linearization of the MFS model in comparison with Monte Carlo simulation results. Finally, an SCED-braced five-story frame structure is optimized by minimizing the maximum ductility demand for the SCED braces using the equivalent linearization of the MFS model. The optimized design by the MFS model is observed to exhibit uniform ductility demands along the height. This can be considered as the ideal optimal solution. The responses of the multi-degree-of-freedom structure also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MFS model and its equivalent linearization.

Abstract: While buckling-restrained braces offer excellent energy dissipation characteristics, their low post-yield stiffness may result in large residual drifts and interstory drift concentration when used in simply supported frames. This paper introduces a new multistage buckling-restrained brace to help mitigate these design challenges. The proposed device features two low yield point (LYP) cores with LY225 and short yield lengths, and one high yield point (HYP) core with SA440B and a longer yield length. In a design level event, the LYP cores dissipate energy, while the parallel HYP core provides an elastic restoring force. At large drifts, the HYP core yields and the device acts similar to a high-capacity, ductile, conventional BRB. A 384 kN specimen was tested at up to 1.5% strain and the individual core contributions recorded using strain gauges attached to the elastic core segments inside the restrainer. The multistage response matched the predicted trilinear backbone, achieving 10 to 20% equivalent damping prior to yielding the HYP core, and a fatigue capacity exceeding three times the AISC 341-16 acceptance criteria. Interaction between the decoupled cores was studied using a 3D finite element model, indicating that minor detailing changes could further improve performance.

Abstract: Super-elastic shape memory alloys (SMAs) are widely used to mitigate seismic responses of engineering structures because of their self-centring and energy dissipation characteristics. However, the energy dissipation capacity of SMAs is limited when compared to other displacement-dependent dampers. In this paper, a novel deformation-amplified SMA-friction damper (DASMAFD) is proposed to control the seismic responses of reinforced concrete (RC) frame buildings. In this damper, a lever system is employed to amplify the deformation that is transferred from the structure to the SMA wires, and a friction adjusting system is adopted to adjust the friction force in the damper. Hence, the proposed novel system is advantageous due to the excellent self-centring capacity of SMAs and the high damping capacity of the friction adjusting system. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, the design and mechanism of the device are presented in detail, the self-centring and damping capacity of the damper are investigated through experimental studies, and the influences of deformation amplification ratio (DAR) and friction ratio (FR) on the self-centring and hysteresis characteristics of the damper are systematically examined. The damper is then applied to control the seismic responses of a 10-storey RC frame building, and numerical simulations are performed to examine the control effectiveness of the proposed system. The calculated responses of the building controlled by a conventional SMA damper are compared with those of a SMA-friction damper. Furthermore, parametric studies are performed to examine the effects of key parameters of the damper, namely DAR and FR, on the seismic responses of the building. Numerical results indicate that DASMAFD exhibits the most evident control effectiveness when compared to other dampers.

Abstract: The structural performance of nailed hold-down connection systems used for cross-laminated timber (CLT) shear walls under monotonic and cyclic loading was experimentally evaluated. Critical connection performance parameters, including strength, stiffness, ductility, and overstrength, were derived from the testing of 68 hold-down connection specimens. The nailed CLT hold-down connections achieved moderate to high ductility when fracture failures of their metal brackets were avoided. The hold-down connection systems with 3 mm thick commercial brackets achieved ductility factors ranged from 2.7 to 4.3, while the hold-down connection systems composed of 10 mm thick steel plates and longer nails achieved larger ductility factors which ranged from 4.7 to 6.3. The overstrength factors of the hold-down systems ranged from 1.45 to 1.62 except the one composed of the 10 mm thick brackets and 100 mm long nails installed at wide spacing. It was also found that the yield strength of the nailed hold-down connections under monotonic loading was similar to that obtained by cyclic loading.
